A trend that starts somewhere civilized (say, New York) causes anger and resentment in, say, Wisconsin. Fast forward a few years and it's in mainstream films and television, and ""cool"" people in New York have moved on. Few more years still and it's gauche in New York, mainstream in pop culture, and, still, the recalcitrant flyovers resist angrily. Finally, the children who grew up in flyover land seeing that trend on the VHS tapes are immunized and end up kind of falling in line with pop culture from 30 years ago, largely because by then their parents are too old and too weak from years of Culvers and Leinenkugel's to stop them. And in the meantime, that trend is also no longer gauche in New York because the oldsters have keeled over from AIDS, and the youngsters don't remember how gauche it once was. Right now we see midwesterners angrily denouncing the newfangled ""carl the cuck hipster nu-male glasses"" while gripping their wireframe glasses from Tom Cruise Mission Impossible as though it were just as important as their guns and bibles. And in the meantime youngsters from the coasts are embracing wireframe glasses as the next big thing. In about 15 more years, carl the cuck hipster nu-male glasses will be the epitome of God-fearing red-blooded Americanness, but for now, they are still a sign of encroaching gay AIDS patients who believe in cultural relativism and the destruction of American freedoms.",7,-1,AskReddit,Strike_Reyhi,1

USB controllers aren't really meant for good hard drive throughput performance. There are special interfaces for hard drives. Plus... you have all those discrete devices. I mean, it could work alright for just data storage, but probably performs shitty. Plus those shitty thumb drives can have relatively high failure rates.

I then congratulate myself, I'm amazing, I just saved us at least $100 service repair bill! Three loads dried and I smell something burning. Run to the laundry room to find smoke billowing out of the dryer. I installed the belt upside down. The inside of the dryer is a mess of molten rubber and plastic. Melted bits stuck all over the place. And the smell, oh god the smell. Even if I could repair it again, I don't think the smell will ever go away. $20 repair ends up costing several hundred dollars to replace the dryer. And of course, we have to replace the pair.

I bought curry last night from our usual sweet centre, we've been going there for years with no worries. I always buy enough for me to eat a second plate at midnight, but I was too full and left it for today. So I put made sure all the boxes were shut and shoved them in the fridge. Onion Bhaji always come in a paper bag so I folded that up and stuck it on the top. Cut to today - I come home from work starving so I plate up immediately; curry, rice, bhaji and dhokra; and stick it in the microwave for about 3 minutes. I ate about two thirds of my plate and looked down at my fork, next to it a piece of rice was moving... only it wasn't a piece of rice. It was a maggot. So now I don't really know what to do. It seemed to come from the rice but I have no way of knowing for sure. All the boxes were definitely shut at midnight, but I can't be sure about the bag of onion bhaji (pretty confident though). We love the place so we don't want to go all gung ho and straight up call Food Standards but we don't really know what to do/or how to approach it. Especially as the food has spent time unattended, like if it had happened immediately after we'd bought it it would be an easy answer - send it back - but we don't know what to do.

""You can't tell me what to do with my body"" ""I'm not hurting anybody but myself"" etc..... Over time more and more of the medical issues were accepted as fact and slowly the number of people smoking went down although typically the changes were forced by forcing smokers to another room or more recently outside. The only problem is that as the next generations grew up they typically had the first 10-13 years of ""not smoking"" even if their parents did as an opportunity to break the cycle.

uid_174051,Good riddance!,2015-04,0,"My Best Friend Practically Said He Wanted to Rape Me. I have two friends in this story. Lets call them Sarah and William. Sarah and I have been friends for years. She is a lovely person and I trust her completely. William and I have been friends for several years. He was my closest male friend and I have shared a lot of life events with him, good and bad. William's sister is getting married at the end of this summer. He invited me to be his plus one to the wedding. His sister is Jewish and her finance is Indian so they are having two weddings which were going to be this big week long affair. Since the wedding festivities were going to be lasting so long naturally people will be staying in a hotel near-by (paid for by the bride and groom). Since I was going to be William's plus one we'd be sharing a hotel room, something I was 100% comfortable with. Well, several weeks ago my friend Sarah texts me saying, ""Don't go to the wedding with William."" I ask her why not since I was very much looking forward to going. To that she replies, ""William says he hopes to get you really drunk at the wedding and then have sex with you."" I was completely outraged. To be honest I lost my mind for a little bit. William knows I have been raped in the past and he knows how I feel about these types of things. He was fully aware of what he was saying and what he was implying. I called William and told him what Sarah said. He didn't deny saying it. I told him why what he said was in no way acceptable. Then I started to get a little hysterical with yelling, crying, and anger. During this whole time he never denied saying what Sarah said he said, he never said he didn't mean it the way it sounded, he never even said he was sorry. Then I hung up. That was the last time I spoke to him. I don't answer his calls or texts and I no longer have an interest in being his friend. It tore me up, still tears me up, that someone I considered a friend would want to do that to me. Especially since he knows my background with the type of thing. I still think about it and it just wreaks me. It makes me even more fearful of making new male friends. I know not all men are evil, terrible people, but I considered this guy to be one of my very best friends and then I find something like this out. It hurts.",7,7,offmychest,MoarCupcakes,0

He looked at the door and saw a planchette sticking out of the door. The teacher was at his desk a Ouija board on his desk. He was pale and looked at my dad. My dad asked what the hell had happened.

Tends to speak for him. Any time he says something legitimately funny, that isn't offensive, she yells at him for making too much noise. Got him started in karate, then started bullying him into quitting when she found out they have to spar (mind you, this is super controlled, light contact sparring. Accidents do happen, but are few and far between). Now he plays every other sport under the sun. She mostly has him involved basketball and travel team soccer, two sports with much higher injury rates than most martial arts. 2- the parent of one of my high school band students. This parent was on my ass over every little thing. They thought I didn't give her kid the credit they deserved? There was an email the next day. Thought I favored another student (who was a better, more talented, and more coachable player)? There was another complaint. You name it, I heard it from this parent. We had a 3-day trip planned, and I let the kids sign up for their ideal rooming situations (assuming you followed the rule of filling an entire room of 6 people to a room at once). This kid signed up for a room with one other person, thinking they would get it to themselves. So, as stated in the rules of the trip, I split them up to fill up two other rooms that had 5 each. Guess what- there was another email, this time requesting a meeting with an administrator.

I'm not good at safewording, unless someone specifically asks how I'm doing, I feel like a massive failure if I take that extra step to use any *official*-sounding safewords to just end what's going on, even if it's just yellow. It feels like I'm being some kind of horrible killjoy and ruining the good time. But I *only* have that reaction to safewords, not to just saying ""no"" or ""no more of that"" or ""my hand is going numb"", or ""I can only take a little more of this"" or ""this one fucking spot on my thigh is a zillion times more sensitive now than anywhere else and if you're gonna hit it, make sure it's on purpose"". Those are all absolutely fine, but I just have the weirdest psychological reaction to red and yellow. Since I don't do con-non-con ever, it's worked fine. There've been situations before I realized this about myself, where I've tried to just sit through situations that upset me. They weren't enough to make me totally freak out then and there, and I just really didn't want to ruin everyone else's fun with even yellowing out of that particular activity, even if the scene continued, which... it probably should not have. Whereas if I'd just felt like it was an option to say ""wait, I'm having a weird emotion, can we stop while I figure it out"", then I could have done that and been absolutely fine. That is just what I do now. It helps that there is literally no state of mind in which I *cannot* talk. I'm at least moderately coherent even after ages of heavy impact, at least if something is going wrong enough that it's distracting me and I'd like it to stop. One time a fwb tried to jokingly smother me with a pillow to get me to stop talking. *Did not stop talking*. The other night I was talking into the hand he was using to cut off my mouth and nose's air supply, just to be sassy (I was not at all understandable, but).

It was called LORAN and was in use up until the 90's. They used ground based transmitters and worked well. Accuracy was a matter of signal quality and operator experience, not any fundamental limit. The receivers would plot out pings sent out by transmitters on an oscilloscope and you would measure their distances apart to calculate the time delay which would allow you to triangulate your position from these known beacon locations. Now we have microcomputers do this math for us, plotting it out on a map. We also have beacon towers everywhere which allows for a higher degree of accuracy as well. Here is a test you can do for yourself that will give you a decent idea that we are dealing with terrestrial based towers; simply board an aircraft - fire up your phone's GPS and you'll get a good fix. When you climb to altitude, this mysteriously fails, more often than not. I say more often than not because I did have a Nokia Lumia 928 which worked consistently, while all other phones before or since have failed.

It's a very delicate balance that we live in and just removing wins and losses and beefing up QS would lead to a very large imbalance on the side of SP's. So instead, I was able to discover that we can weight certain scores differently depending on the running total. So now, pitching 8IP will net the same extra +3 that a W would have (extra 1.5 for 7th and 8th IP each). Similarly allowing 6 ER will net the same extra -3 that a L would have (extra -1 for 4th/5th/6th ER allowed). Relief pitchers needed some balancing as well, as the pitchers that were entering in tie games were not being properly rewarded/penalized for their performance, hence the relief wins/losses built to mirror the holds/blown saves.

Most of the conversation had consisted of: ""Just turn on a TV! It's on every channel!"" The whole airport had been shut down, the goddamn ladies' room had been cordoned off, and at this point estimates were that there were no less than fifty-three people in there, Linda included. At one point they'd taken the door off the hinges and sent people in as a human chain. Just watching it, just looking in from a distance had been nauseating, the white tile warping subtly and curving and seeming to go on forever. Someone's grip had slipped, and another nine people lost to the ladies' room. The survivors had told horror stories about blood and other bodily fluids, toilets clogged and overflowing. They'd eventually had to put the door back up. The plan now was to just blow open a wall on the side of the ladies' room, make it so that it wasn't a room anymore. Current scuttlebutt was about what would happen to the people who were still inside. There was a lot of talk about shaped charges, controlled demolition, words that made my head spin. I was on my knees, praying, when there was a sudden rush of air out of the room, like everyone taking a breath. The door swung open and Linda stepped out, primping her hair, as fine as the moment she'd walked in. Twenty four hours living in an airport had turned me into a goddamn mess. The crowd burst into cheers, rushing around her, two officers ushering her away from the door as she looked around in shock. I was pushing up-current through the crowd, screaming, ""It's me! Linda, it's me! That's my wife! Oh my god, that's my wife!"" There were hands on the both of us pushing us forwards, and then she was in my arms again and everyone else mercifully backed away. ""Linda!"" I said, and collapsed on my knees, dragging my head down to her waist. ""Oh my god, Linda, I thought I lost you, you were in there for hours, hours, over a day!"" Her pretty little eyes blinked and she stared down at me. ""I - A day? Really? I mean, I knew it was a long time, but I didn't think -"" ""I'm just so glad you're safe,"" I said, and pulled myself up to my feet, kissing her straight on the lips. ""What the hell happened in there, Linda? What were you doing in there all this time?"" ""Well,"" she said, and frowned slightly and extricated herself from my arms.

He was the only bright light at the end of that season, but he hasn't shown much since. Best case scenario: he gets time to grow at Dortmund and comes home a better player. Worst case: he looks good at Dortmund and moves there permanently. I'm not trying to rain on anyone's parade: I quite like Januzaj and hope he does become world class for us. But I haven't seen anything to indicate that it is likely to happen. He just hasn't contributed much (he always seems a touch or step off of something brilliant offensively, and doesn't work very hard defensively). Wilson seems in the same boat to me. No idea about Pereira or Lingard, and I'd like to see them get some chances.

Companies are responsible for the interests of all individuals involved in their operation. This includes employees, suppliers, shareholders (if registered on a stock exchange), etc. Let's say that 5000 people have an interest in some kind in this company - whether their wages are being paid or they have stock ownership or whatever - and you suddenly decide to start funneling profits toward environmental efforts instead of paying more wages or doing a dividend because it's the ""right thing to do for the environment"". The money's got to come from somewhere. My question to you is just this: where do you get off assuming you have the right to make a decision with the money of 5000 people? While Jane in sales might support the company's decision, Joe in manufacturing with 3 kids and a wife in the hospital probably needs every penny he can get. I am grossly oversimplifying but the point is that it's not about money for the sake of greed, or fuck the environment, or anything like that. Money is simply the most mutually agreeable end result of a company's operations, which is the work of many people and teams combined, since they can then decide for themselves what to do with that money. Jane can donate to rainforest restoration, and Joe can make a payment on his second mortgage. Always baffles me when people think companies just have money that they could be using to save the environment and they are laughing maniacally in the board room and keeping it there, not using it on purpose.

We would like to ask you to be cognizant about how you interact and post both here and in the opposition's sub. As playoffs often bring out the worst in some, we are changing some of our procedures during game day. Most of these will be behind the scenes, but there is an important one to mention. At some point during the game, we will likely be locking the subreddit so that no submissions can be made. We will still allow replies, however. If we win, it will be lifted not long after the game--maybe an hour or two. If we lose, it will stay locked longer until the glut of trolls diminish. You can help with all of this in two ways: 1. Report, report, report. If you see something posted that is trolling or posted to cause conflict, please report it. Even if it's borderline, we will review it and determine. We only have so many eyes and all your help will be huge on making things smooth. 2. Be proactive. Stay out of the opposition's sub. Nothing is gained by going there. Stay out of arguments that will flair up. We don't care if you disagree with someone and talk about it, but when it devolves into name calling and accusations, that is a problem.

I put in my two weeks notice about two weeks ago on Wednesday March 6th. I've thought long and hard about my decision and I decided that my time was better served helping other Bitcoin companies. I was recently brought onto the team for [BitcoinStore](http://bitcoinstore.com) and will continue spending more of my time working on that project. I'd like to thank all the customers I had the pleasure of meeting and talking with! You guys rock, seriously. All the troubles and delays Coinabul went through and yet most of you were patient and kind. As for the recent kerfuffle, I guess that is partly why I am leaving Coinabul. Jay has now resolved both issues that gained notoriety on the forums and this subreddit, but I felt pretty much helpless to solve the issues because ""Jay's in charge"". We've recently been disagreeing on which directions to head and well, I now know which way I'm heading. This does not imply that the direction he wants to take Coinabul is not a valid one. This is not me saying that the company is bad, it isn't. I'm still amazed at how quickly we amassed orders and how much we've grown in less than two years.

Amount of energy. They take off from this 1h=7years gravity-well planet (The one with the waves.) with that posh jet ship of theirs like it's nothing, even though that's *huge* gravity gradient to overcome. Seriously, it's *gigantic*. If 1 hour is 1.1 hours once you're away, you already have gravity several times that of Jupiter. If 1 hour is 2 hours, we're already talking astronomic unit sized stars or something. But 1 hour is 7 years - that would take fuel reserves of pure matter-antimatter of a volume that clearly doesn't fit into any man-made structure. There is just no way in the universe to store that amount of energy inside such a small ship other than ""Somehow!"", which is not how we should explain plotholes away. Especially not in such a science-heavy movie. ---- And there's another thing: Before the film's mission, there had been others. How in the Hell did they keep the launches a secret?

I don't understand the whole argument that women can't do physically demanding work traditionally reserved to men.

I believe this reluctancy to include women in heavy works comes from a more or less unconscious belief that women's life is more valuable than ours because they are child bearers and they shouldn't waste themselves doing too much physical or hazardous work. whenever someone mentions gender quotas is always about leadership positions or company boards and no mention of steel mills or constructions. :-(",3,3,MensRights,lordslag,1

I also love Monster hunter and it is the game I'm looking the most forward to, But Majoras mask is my favorite Zelda game.

uid_63884,We got a live one here!,2016-08,0,"Yes, social moderate. Perhaps I defined it myself. For example, I think gay people should be able to be legally recognized as together. But they should not be afforded the economic incentives (eg: tax benefits) of ""marriage"" because they cannot procreate, which is the primary reason the incentives were put there, to encourage procreation. Fully support HB2. Charlotte, and other cities, would've put into place legalized thrills for people who wanted to go into the opposite sex's bathroom. A few years ago no one would've thought about the idea but because ""identifying as X"" became well-known any frat kid, for example, could've used that new found knowledge to his advantage. I also respect the privacy expectations of individuals who aren't comfortable with trans folks being around them. I think it's insane to drastically overhaul life to make a minute fraction of a population ""feel"" better. HB2 did not affect private businesses whatsoever in terms of the bathroom. In fact, it called for public agencies to accommodate trans folks and encouraged them to build neutral facilities if needed. More on HB2, I am vehemently against the government threatening funding to manipulate state decisions. In terms of employment/wage laws that the bill covered it standardized these across the state. What if Charlotte decides $30 is the minimum wage? The economic effects would affect the state dramatically. Yes, I am very pro-life. I firmly believe there is no logical way to conclude pro-choice is acceptable and moral unless in the cases of rape, incest, or if the child were to be born with handicaps. Teachers in NC are paid, when adjusted for cost of living, the same as the vast majority of states. I do not think teachers should see an increase in salaries to $50,000 (this is Republican leadership raising teacher salaries after NC Democrats cut them). There is a huge supply of teachers, they work nine months of the year, ""good teachers"" get paid the same as ""bad teachers"" (how do you even measure that?), tenure exists, etc. And your comment about ""well regulated"" demonstrates your complete lack of legal and Constitutional knowledge of the Second Amendment including what ""well-regulated"" meant.",10,10,NorthCarolina,FormerFastCat,0

I said I really enjoy academia and want to do post-docs and eventually get a permanent position in a university. This is very hard to achieve. I also joking said, ""but if that doesn't work out, I've always wanted to be an astronaut."" *Haha*. They laughed but then said ""If that's what you really want, you should stick to it."" and, ""It's not impossible."" and, ""Why the hell not? Someone has to do it."" One person even said, ""Don't let anyone tell you what you can and can't do."" So the usual, friendly encouragement of both my real goal and my big dream as you would expect from friends. Then came the other half of the conversation which followed immediately after this as it was still along the same lines of future plans, ""So when are you going to pop a sprog?"" and I told them I wasn't. I didn't want to. Pregnancy sounds awful, birth sounds worse and then, worst of all, a child. Urgh. Nope. **All** of them began saying ""You'll change your mind"", ""you're young"", ""it's different"" yada yada. Usually I'm pretty chill about this, I'm used to it. People can say what they like it doesn't change a thing. **However** they had *just* been saying that they believed I am old enough and educated enough to make the, quite frankly absurd, life choice **to become an ASTRONAUT.** Let me repeat that: an astronaut.

Against our better judgement but whatever, 2 security guards saw and took the pipe but what we didn't know was our friend behind us was rearranging her purse at the time, which also just so happened to have her leftover shrooms in it which she planned on taking later that night. The security guards told her to come with them, and they led her backstage. While she was backstage she was handed off to a senior officer who apparently put her through a Scared Straight sort of routine - he showed her the various people awaiting conviction, some rapists who had tried taking advantage of rolling girls earlier that night, some sellers who apparently were going to serve some big time, etc. Then he took down her info, gave her a slap on the wrist, took her drugs and released her back into the festival. She joined us again and we celebrated the rest of the night. We were so thankful that that was all that happened to her, it could have been so much worse. FAST FORWARD TO TODAY and we find out a fourth security guard bribed one of the three other guards for her information and is now texting her asking for dates, sexual favors, etc. He has her phone number, name, address, everything she was made to believe security would keep private.

uid_634791,Play Verdun,2016-09,0,"Why pretend to call yourself a World War I game, if you're not going to adhere to the era? #whining You're a soldier in World War I, chances are you are armed with a bolt action rifle, from either the allies or the enemy side. That's it. I don't know what history books Dice were drawing from, but the over proliferation of hand held SMGs, hand held MGs, and a dazzling array of sniper optics (they really weren't that common in WWI) essentially spit in the face of the concept of Standard Issue, give up all pretense this is a WWI game, for the sake of ""Hurp, it's fun!"" I get that these games cost millions to make, and they have to build the game for the lowest common denominator call of duty player to make their money back. But why WWI if you're not even going to enforce weapon regulations. (response to those ""it's an option, you can turn it off chuckleheads further down). I get it, ""because it's fun"" and you know what, this game is actually pretty fun, in an arcade I'm running around in a defensive circle at C point shooting people in the back this is fucking retarded, kind of fun. - The same for the tank play, except you can pick your nose at the same time. Not to mention, it's really bullet spongy, I'm sure we've all emptied a clip into a horseman and he's still trucking along like he's playing single player Skyrim, giving no fucks at all. Oh and the mobility, amazing, did you know you can carry a rifle, 3 charges of TNT, a gas mask, an anti tank rifle - and sprint non stop as if you were part of the Russian Olympic track and field team? Well of course you can! it's fun! hyuk hyuk. Ultimately I would of liked a game that was tailored around actual shit that was happening in WWI, not an SMG sniper fest, where tanks aren't broken pieces of shit like they were in WWI. No instead we get this game that doesn't know what it wants to be, too scared to depart thoroughly from its battlefield 3 and 4 trends, despite calling itself Battlefield 1. Why not Battlefield 5? Is the number 1 to signify a departure of something or a formula? Because it sure doesn't look like it. And some nay-sayers will just hand wave this, and say ""WELL THERE's AN OPTION FOR YOU TO ONLY HAVE BOLT ACTIONS IN THE SERVER CREATION, USE THAT."" Yes, I just also hope there's an option to pull up the maps that don't exist that are tailored to bolt action gameplay. One could complain about the tanks and vehicles too and you would argue back ""WELL JUST REMOVE THEM IN SERVER OPTIONS"", that would leave maps like Sinai desert, a walking simulator. The point being, all the maps are getting designed to be played a specific multi-armed call of duty with tanks way. Not for methodical bolt action, tough as balls gameplay. That's a shame. So in the name of ""fun"" we decided to sacrifice every element of what WWI as a fighting era is; a ball breaking agony. Instead, give all the soldiers steroids, and pretend like SMGs and Scopes were ""just how it was"". Shit then, why not include wall jumping? It's fun right? You just gave up giving two shits about the era 3 game design sessions ago. Hey you can always leave an option to turn it on and off in the options right? Why not jet packs?

uid_963886,I don't see why honor summon can't scale to level like with login bonuses.,2014-10,0,"It sort of is already a thing. They did it once with the Mifune batch. You can honor summon them at a low rate or farm them in St. Lamia. I was kind of expanding that to the maps already in place and their respective bosses as the content ages to keep it usable. Game designers love recycling or re-purposing things already in game. Especially as the game gets bigger. I'm kind of on the fence about the honor summoning them. I personally think Honor Summon needs an entire revamp. Maybe make it a mix of the three star units you can farm on the maps released (better BB fodder for older players, and decent fillers for new players as they work toward their first few Rare Summons), and evo mats (all of them, with appropriate rates -- mimics of all types, totems, pots, idols), jewel units, and ghost units. Get the useless fodder out of there. The only problem with that becomes, what to do with the six heroes...

Although Westerosi customs differ from real life, in some parts of the world, the idea of men kissing other men could be associated with homosexuality. * In S4E3, Loras eats an apple. In medieval iconography, apples were associated with sin and temptations, and homosexuality in particular. He also attracts the look of Oberyn Martell, another character speculated by fans to engage in sex with men. * In S5E1, Loras lies in bed with Olyvar.

I left because the more I learned about the Mormon believes, the more it weirded me out. Still, ever since I left I miss the feeling, the people, the community the YSA evenings. I left because my head assured me that it's nothing but rubbish, but my heart is still in there. I watch relief society when there is general conference and am deeply touched, but once they talk about the BoM I find myself getting a little angry inside. Because I am a christian and the whole idea of salvation in the Mormon church (especially as a woman) is just wrong. Every time things don't go so well in my life, I really have to hold myself back from going there. I have been to numerous churches and none have the same community, Sunday school, offers and are in it with the same heart.

Perfect world scenario is where a swat team and hostage negotiator are available and on hand to respond immediately. But life isn't like the movies. Those resources just aren't available at the drop of a hat. It's a horrible, terrible, obscene tragedy, but I don't think this is a case of an out of control cop. He entered the property which doesn't read like him trying to put his life above others and reads more like him going in to try an assess the situation but on entering was confronted by a terrible choice to make. Should he have entered the property? Well, that's kind of his job and totally sounds like him walking into danger. Should he have fired his gun as soon as the perp aimed at him? Yes. This isn't the movies. If someone points a gun at you, the only logical assumption to make is that they're going to pull the trigger with intent to kill and a dead cop is no use to anyone and makes the situation even worse - chances are the hostage would have died anyway.

uid_939298,But But ... BIG OIL and the KOCH bros... They are the conspiracy.,2015-12,0,"Never forget, **promotion of ""Climate Change"" is now an entire INDUSTRY in and of itself.** A rather large number of people earn their entire living (salaries and even in a few cases ""benefits"") off of continuing to push/promote this stuff. An *even larger* number of businesses &amp; people (advertising &amp; PR firms, and of course the graphic artists &amp; other staff people they employ) earn a significant PART of their living. -- Those people all now have a vested interest in keeping this stuff going -- to admit that it was false... Well, to admit it and DO SOMETHING about that (like quit or refuse to create/promote the material that one is ""tasked"" with, or even attempt to introduce some honesty or objectivity or even any caveats or ""doubt"")... well that would mean *not* being able to repay the student loans, or to pay the rent &amp; utilities, and of course in many cases to risk the house, the car, the health insurance, any ""presents"" for the kid(s), etc. Even far short of that -- even to admit *internally* and to themselves that it's ""not entirely true"" -- is to begin to *dislike* their job (and not just over trivial matters), and even, presuming there is some ""conscience"" present in each individual, to eventually begin to *hate themselves* for being complicit in such a large hoax, or fraud upon the public. -- So what do people do? Well, they engage in ""thought stopping"", that is they ""won't go there"", not even for a moment in their mind (or at least not if they can help it) will they contemplate any doubts -- in fact in order to avoid thinking those potentially ""heretical"" things, they will become *more* strident, recommit themselves to their core dogmatic belief(s). Which of course then provides more than sufficient fuel to go into work the following week and produce things like... well like the linked graphic. -- Thus the end result is much like the world of Orwell's *1984* the GOAL of a lot of this propaganda... ***isn't*** really to try to convince the ""proles"" (they're too busy being kept entertained &amp; occupied by the ""prolefeed"", i.e. what are the Kardashians up to, etc) -- rather its to try to keep the ""party members"" -- i.e. everyone ELSE in the government &amp; NGO ""industry"" (or the ""faith"" if you will) both thinking ""correct"" thoughts as well as to keep them ""keyed up"" to continue their own little complicit parts in maintaining the wider ""establishment"".",3,3,climateskeptics,ozric101,1

uid_539989,"Boy, it is almost as if the Jews killed Christ or something",2015-11,0,"The truth is that it's because of the Jews that we even started the whole 'war on Christmas' fiasco. Think about it, if you're atheist and I say Merry Christmas you say thanks or something, or you explain to me how there is no God and you also stopped eating meat and joined crossfit. But you don't naturally respond with ""happy holidays"". What does that even mean? That there are more than one holiday to celebrate at this time of year. Well "" Happy Holidays"" started before Kwanzaa was even conceived, so it wasn't Kwanzaa's fault. It isn't anything Muslim. It's because of Hannaka. Chanukah is hard to spell and with more than one holiday these signs were getting expensive. Marketers decidedninstead of having a hanakuh sign and a Christmas sign and trying to decide the Jewish calendar theynciukd just say happy holidays and everyone would be happy. Even the atheists because in the US a day off work is rare enough thst hopefully they won't ruin that for everyone else. Plus you can keep the sign up until new years if you really want to. Also, it was Christian's friends, the Jews, who made it personal. They knew and cared for Jews and didn't want them to be left out of all the fun of Christmas. Baptists will tell you that they should have been evangelizing and converting souls, not trying to be inclusive on a superficial red cup level, but that's hard work converting the Jews. So instead people just changed the signs. And now all of an sudden it's supposed to be this atheist led SJW war against Christians? It was always about capitalism, not being as hardcore as Baptists, the price of sign lettering, the confusing spelling of chanukahh and not running in how awesome Christmas is to our friends (and bosses). There's not a war against Christmas. There has never been a war against Christmas. If you want to be outraged Christmas from a Christian perspective the target isn't ""happy holidays"" but rather the entire fucking fiasco of the commercialization of the event. From black Friday to Santa Clause, the whole damn thing. Have a Christmas with no tree and no presents and just pray about stuff and don't shop and don't stress and don't astch any tc for three months so Christmas hymns won't have the lyrics changed to sell cars and see if when you are close to God again and far from Macy's if ""happy holidays"" still offends you.

uid_348800,Don't have an abortion.,2016-02,0,"I've got some pretty strong anti-abortion convictions. How can I ""practice what I preach""? Let me explain... --- **Background:** I'm pretty strongly opposed to abortion. **(1)** I think human embryos and fetuses are 100% *human*. **(2)** I think when two adults have a child, they have taken responsibility for the life of that child. MOST abortions happen for reasons that these two beliefs strike down hard. Things like ""I'm too young/old"", ""I don't want people to know"", or ""I can't afford it"" are NOT acceptable excuses in my book. You did a grown-up thing. Accept the grown-up responsibility. There are a few cases where I'd at least be willing to *talk*... But these aren't very representative of most abortions. --- **However...** I recognize that *this is not easy and it should not be taken lightly*. Real people are in really difficult circumstances. I absolutely don't think we should harden our hearts to the issues people face and the realities of a broken world. We need *compassion* for everyone involved. And we need *practical solutions*, for everyone's sake. One of the biggest criticisms I hear directed at those against abortion is that we aren't being reasonable or that we don't care. To some extent, that's said by people who don't really know what they're talking about. But to some extent it's true. And I don't want to be part of the demographic that makes it true. --- **So what to do?** I think part of the solution is political. I think that anyone who opposes abortion should support things like better sex ed and access to contraceptives. So we can talk about solutions like this if you want. *But I'm looking for some practical ideas of what I can do.* I thought perhaps this might be a good community to ask. We've got people on both sides of the issue, but I think both sides generally *care*. Are there places to volunteer? Organizations to support? Conversations that need to be had?

We went down to the DMV to get it. I don't remember the identification he had with him at the time but it wasn't good enough. They needed his birth certificate. So we contacted the state where he was born (in the 1950s) and we could not find a record of him. They basically told me ""yeah, we don't have a birth certificate for him. Sorry."" Then we were told we needed to file paperwork to request that a birth certificate be created, but that even then we might not get it because this required a special consideration by some government agency. I'm sitting there and thinking ""this is a person. He's sitting right here next to me. But you're telling me that there is no record that he exists, and you can't give him a record so he can get a little card that he can show people to prove that he exists."" Honestly, I eventually left that job before I ever found out if old Robert got his proof of his existence. The moral of the story is that you have to fall back on the principle that for democracy to work, EVERYBODY needs to be equally able to vote. When you start requiring that everyone needs to pay to have an ID you have created a barrier to voting. In come cases, you are talking about people like this guy who literally had zero income and he was not receiving any kind of disability benefits. He got a voucher for his living arrangements and for his food he used food stamps or the free food shelf. Even for people who do work, it's often a minimum wage job and maybe that person has 4 kids too. Suddenly, you see that the $15 or $20 needed for an ID (PLUS the transportation to get the ID, PLUS the need for paperwork to show to verify who you are) becomes a pretty significant problem. It's like one of the least important things in the world for that person to get an ID. And yet these are the kinds of people who should be able to vote. Their vote is every bit as important as the votes of people who have all they need.",1,1,explainlikeimfive,fickle_fuck,1

This is why I think isis is doing so well, they thrive off the fear in western countries and use our reactions to power their narrative, the one that says we're in some holy war.

uid_996282,The only constant in your games is you.,2015-06,0,"My opinion and critique of FACEIT-NA Open League. I'm a rather new Dota player compared to most, and I only discovered the league scene a year ago. At that time, IXDL-O was the leading open league and NEL was the leading invitational league. While at times it was a struggle to play one game (dead league) in a day there were other times where the league was quite populated. Eventually I earned an invite to NEL through the open league (though my skill was close to the bottom of the league) and played in that for a couple of months. In May, ixmike88 closed both IXDL-O and NEL and 'moved' the leagues to FACEIT and FPL. While FPL has been a success, attracting more skilled players than NEL and achieving a new level of exclusivity, FACEIT open league has many flaws which did not exist in IXDL-O and need to be mended. So with that let me examine and present some of the thoughts which come to my mind about the league. * No IRC chat. One of the main features of the IXDL client was IRC. FACEIT doesn't have an IRC chat, instead having a clunky chat for both out-of-game discussion and pre-game discussion, requiring closing the chat and reopening it to update it. In addition, nobody even uses it. Despite there being 6 games and more players in queue right now, the last chat message posted was one hour ago and before that seven hours. Part of league play is to be more than just gamefinding, it's to build up a strong playerbase who have the potential to form teams who will drive competition in the future. If there's no easy way for players to socialize things are just the same as if it were normal ranked queuing. * No forums. Not only is there no easy chat for communication between players and staff, there's no forums! How this could possibly be seen as a good design decision is beyond me. There's no easy way to voice complaints or further expansion of a community. * No apparent moderation. I have never seen a mod. Nobody is watching games. Replays are inaccessible, players who intentionally throw games (not even starting with people whose skill level is so low that they should still be playing vs bots) are left unpunished. IXDL-O and NEL had visible, active, and effective moderation. Players who threw games were warned, players who disobeyed captain were warned. Being captain doesn't mean anything when your 2k player gets to take a hero from your 5k player which ends up costing the game. There is no way to prevent players like this losing games. It shows that there's no leadership from the staff of FACEIT and it's especially a problem because it makes the moderation just as disconnected from the users as in regular matchmaking, except in regular matchmaking you at least get a message when someone you reported had action taken against them. * Matchmaking is incredibly flawed. Teams stacked with two diamonds and a master against a team with one gold player and four unranked are common in my games. While I don't have access to every game to see how things are nor are there any accessible winrate stats, I would wager that Radiant wins at least 70% of their games. Not because of the inherent Radiant advantages in the game, but because the matchmaking is faulty and stacks players on Radiant. However, I have no evidence to back this point up so it remains a simple observation as a player that I feel is true. Because of all of these reasons, FACEIT remains only slightly superior to matchmaking instead of being miles ahead of it. If FACEIT wants to improve as an organization and a league it needs to make major changes, especially to the overall platform, which is antithetical to the very ideas of league play. The games I've played have been mostly one sided stomps while solid games are few and far between. It's completely a step down from IXDL-O and needs major rethinking.",-2,-2,DotA2,Outhouse_Defiler,1

uid_576952,"Sherlock, is that you?",2014-09,0,"In our game, the Rogue (Half-Orc Rogue, too, damn I love the new racially open feel to 5th ed) has a passive perception of over 20. 21 or 23 or something. I'd have to check again, but it's well over 20. He took Observant. So, what that means.... I give him everything. Period. I pass notes to him constantly, he is both empowered by and absolutely crippled by this ability. Every scene, every room... I'll describe what's up and then either verbally or through a note describe what he notices on top of it. So, practically that means when in the shop, everyone sees the clerk and his goods and those swords there and the counter and the cash box and all that. The Rogue sees all that and has a note about roughly how much is probably in that box from the sound of it, across the room; the type of lock on that cabinet, that the shop keep has a dagger under his vest on the left side; that the place smells faintly of rotting apples probably from some garbage or something upstairs that makes him a little nauseated. When in the dungeon? Over there? Trap. On that square there. Two people, at least, talking behind that door over there. The hobgoblin coming at him is taller than the rest and has a rank insignia different than the other four. He gets to know who is more or less hurt looking around him. He gets to smell Orcs on the wind. He gets to hear flapping in the distance and the sound of something metallic clinking in the dark... ...all when nobody else does. Now, often as not, I hit him with things that aren't necessarily plot or danger relevant. Just because he gets a note--as far as the players are concerned--doesn't mean it matters. I keep giving him stuff to couch the REAL stuff away from meta-game expectations of notes = danger. And he plays it well. When he notices some guy pissing in a far corner of the warehouse they're meeting a gang leader in, he just doesn't mention it to anyone. He doesn't talk about all the times he smells the different levels of BO or freshness in the party. Doesn't talk about all the different flowers around the campsite he's noticed or how many bats seems to be flying at night while they walk through the woods or that the temperature in THIS room in the dungeon is a little colder than the last room but also a little quieter. So, it makes it more powerful when he's able to--because people have tuned out the ""note passing""--surprise people by calmly saying while walking through town... ""We're being followed, started a few blocks back--there are six of them, one's on the roof over my left shoulder and the other five are those kids that keep playing with the sticks loudly. They're not kids, though, halflings... good actors, not good enough. Don't know why, but they keep eyeballing us and following and at least one of them--the one with the brown hat--he's got a crossbow in that sack."" And everyone is like ""oh... shit... "" Anyhow. Play with it. It doesn't break the game. In our last combat I drew out the scene on the battle mat and made an ""accidental"" few marks while doing it. Real subtle, nothing more than a little line. Then I ""tried erasing them"" and they smudged a bit. Nobody thought of it. When the battle started, I sent my Rogue a note ""smudges are the edges of some kind of trap--you see the work, but don't know WHAT it is--remember THEY can't see smudges"". So he was shouting as people were running into the room: ""No.... no, don't go over to THAT wall. Stay away from that ledge there!"" because he saw what others didn't. It was cool. Monk ran right through a trap because Rogue couldn't articulate EXACTLY where things were in the heat of battle.",1,1,dndnext,Biffingston,0

When I wrote it I was afraid I was being too fair to GamerGate. There were some wording mistakes in my criticism of GG, which I corrected, but I went in to game ethics for over half of the article and dealt with it in two parts: games journalism ethics and SJWs ruing gamer culture. Going in to it I'll admit I was pretty anti-GG. I'm not sure how anyone can look at all the claims of misogyny and abuse and not be at least a little bit against it. I posted it in Kotakuforaction. Ok, not a smart move on my part, but I'd assumed it was a discussion subreddit rather than a pro-GG one. As I watched my karma plummet, I was bombarded with ""prove it was us"" and ""citation needed for the harassment"" etc. While I wanted to say something along the lines of ""don't pretend you've no idea what I'm on about"" I was left with the reality that I had no proof at hand. I've been looking in to the pro-GG side for the last few days. For most of it I felt like that cartoon on the right. Some of the examples I was given were very weak, but others were genuine concerns about games journalism. I am against everything that the anti-GG side says GG are about. I'm for the ethics in games journalism that the pro-GG side says GG are about.

I'm going to wade into this. Feel free to disagree, but I'm going to try and lay some things out for those who don't see what the issue is. I grew up with the original trilogy. I saw ROTJ before puberty, and my friends and I were mesmerized by Leia. There was the one kid who insisted that his cousin had a Kenner Slave Leia action figure. Dammit, I wanted that figure too! (For those of you who don't know, there wasn't one. It was just myth until the 90s.) So, Slave Leia became a thing. The Friends episode from the 90s actually captured some of the allure of this outfit. But then I had to go ruin it all by having kids. Yup, I have daughters, and a lot of this slave Leia stuff bothers me. Part of the problem is that by focusing on this outfit, it undercuts Leia's agency in the film. In ROTJ, she puts her life on the line to save her boyfriend's life, gets captured, but then strangles the slimy dude who captured her. Take that. Leia's a badass. But look at this card? Do we get agency? Do we get a badass? Nope, we get submission. She's looking down, she's chained. We don't get Leia the ass-kicker, we get Leia lounging and showing off her body. And Topps is tellings us that Leia, posed thusly, will ""capture our attention."" But I do acknowledge that this scene happened, and does indeed make sense in the context of the story. My preference? Skip this card. Maybe acknowledge the outfit by using a shot where she is *doing something*. Strangling Jabba, shooting the sail barge gun, or even swinging to safety again. The real problem is what this outfit has become, outside of the movie. Go google ""slave leia art"" or ""slave leia fan art."" Umm... wow. Those images do not convey the picture of a leader, of a woman who went to save her boyfriend who got his ass frozen and hung on the wall in some backwater in the outer rim of the galaxy. That is a woman who exists to fuel our fantasies. That is my problem with this card, it hews too close to that Leia, rather than the badass that she could be. I'm not upset, but I'm not pulling this card. That's all. I just wanted to give you guys some context why people might have a problem with it.",6,6,starwarstrader,MephistoSchreck,1

Here's how the electoral college works: The people vote. The vote in each district are tallied up and a winner of each district and/or state is determined. Depending on the state either the overall winner of that state gets all of that state's electoral votes, or the votes are split between candidates based on how many districts each of them won + 2 electoral votes determined by a statewide election (this is only done in Nebraska and Maine). The president-elect is the candidate that wins the absolute majority of electoral votes (currently 270). If no candidate wins a majority of the votes, the president is selected from the top-three candidates by the house, and the VP is selected from the top-three VP candidates by the senate. The house has selected the president twice: once in 1801, and once in 1825. The senate has selected the VP once in 1837. If the House is deadlocked and unable to make a selection, the VP becomes acting president until they are able to do so. If Senate is similarly unable to select a VP, the Speaker of the House becomes acting president according to the order of succession until a president or vice president is selected. This has never occurred. It is illegal in 24 states for an elector to either vote against their pledge or to not vote. These are called faithless electors and have *never changed a presidential election in US history*. tl;dr When you vote for president, you are voting not for the president, but for an elector that has pledged to vote for the particular candidate you think you've voted for. If the popular vote didn't matter, presidential candidates wouldn't spend billions of dollars campaigning publicly. Is the electoral college a perfect solution? Not really, but keep in mind the electoral college going against the popular vote is exceedingly rare.",3,3,politics,TCMMT,1

uid_536886,"Just ignore 4Kids, and GX (and hell, even 5Ds) is right up there with the original series.",2016-12,-1,"Yu-Gi-Oh GX Respect Thread Yugioh GX was both a great manga and a great Anime but it does get a lot of flack. I understand that we were right off the heels of the Yugi vs Yami Duel. A great duel to end a great series and then to many peoples surprise we went to something...happier, lighter than what we were used to. And to many that was a turn off. Yugioh DM started off with the Shadow Games, right off the back souls were taken, Cards were ripped and peoples sight was on the line. But Yugioh GX started off with more of a slice of life, being more comedic and friendly. And the 4Kids Dub made it even more of a comedy. This caused a lot of people to stop watching, and thus miss an entirely great series. The first season was different, but had a lot to offer. From the birth of Manjoume Thunder, to the great Duels that Ryou had. Season 1 is admittedly the weakest out of the four. Season 2 is where things really pick up. Ryou loses and turns into Hell Kaiser, Judai loses and gains the NeoSpacians, Aster Phoenix is introduced, a Zero Turn Kill happens, We get to see Old Man Mutou and Kaiba again and Manjoume is the one who wins the tournament. On top of all of this we also get to see a Naked Bastion, A God Card and we get to see the Villain refuse to Duel. Saou gets the key he needs for the satellite looks over to Judai and essentially says 'Why would I duel you?' Now in come Season 3. We start off with the arrival of five new duelists, each of them supposed to be the best of their schools. We get great duels with each of the New Comers. We get to see another dimension where essentially a Yugioh verson of the Zombie Apocalypse happens. We are introduced to one of the best villains in Anime (Yubel). Then we go to another dimension. Characters die, so many characters die. But what is so great about this, is Judai is the one to do this. He rushed in and got his friends killed, he turned to darkness and killed more of his friends. Aster battles Exodia, Kaiser gets an extremely good duel against Yubel. Adrian falls to Yubel too. Then Judai and Yubel fuse. Finally we arrive at the final season. Judai has matured in not only mind but looks too. His dueling style changes from having fun, to winning as quick as possible, but we also learn that he is dealing with depression. We see other characters cap off their character arcs. Manjoume beating Aster, Sho becoming a Cyber Duelist, Asuka going to become a teacher. Atticus having a great duel where he actually beats Fujiwara but time stuff happens. On top of all that we get to see Judai face Yugi and Yami. To put it plainly, GX has some of the best duels in the series. Most of those great duels come from Season 3 and Season 4. The series has the best character development and even develops the side characters, making them never static but ever changing to the environment around them. The villains past season 1 were great and I think Yubel is probably one of the best villains in the series. Her motivation wasn't to conquer or destroy but to express her love to Judai. Her plan was the most destructive and she had some of the best duels. Yubel also had a good win rate and buildup. This is something that Yugioh usually lacks in their villains, they usually have only one duel where they lose to the main character. GX had a satisfying ending that tied up most of the characters, which is a plus compared to most animes now a days. It's a shame to see GX trashed on, because it is legitamently a great show that people should give a chance.",0,-1,yugioh,SSDuelist,0

Fast forward to about 10 mins ago, when a supervisor told me to check the printer. So, even though I was sure it wouldn't boot, I dutifully went and checked on it. Turns out the power cable had been disconnected from the back. The first step when something won't turn on is always ""is it plugged in?"", yet I went 3 hours without figuring that out.

Working in tech support can be frustrating at times, especially when you have a customer who treats you like dirt. Talking about those calls with people who understand how difficult that can be is so helpful and makes dealing with those customers much easier. I worked technical support for a medical coding company for 2 + years. It was basic technical support. Login issues, download assistance, issues fixed with compatibility view and clearing cookies and cache. Nothing too technical. Students would purchase medical coding books and in those books there would be a CD with a serial number that gave the student temporary access to one of our coding applications. This story is about a call I had with a student about that demo CD. Student - ST / Planet_Kolob - PK PK: Thank you for calling Technical Support, how may I assist you? ST: Hi, this is Sheniqua from ITT Tech (Not really...) and I received one of your demo CDs with my book but it's not working. PK: Okay. I would be happy to assist you today. Now when you say... ST: Yeah so before we begin I think you should know that I'm not your typical caller. I'm tech-savvy. I know what I am doing on a computer. I've taken computer classes in the past. The CD that was in my book doesn't work and I am positive it's nothing I am doing wrong. I think you all should send me a new one. I paid a lot for this and I want what I paid for. PK: Well I'm sorry for the inconvenience. When you say it isn't working, what do you mean exactly? ST: I put the CD in and nothing happens. Nothing pulls up on my screen or anything. It's broke. PK: I see. So you have the CD in drive now? ST: Yeah it's in there right now but nothing's happening. I'm telling you it's broke. I'm not your average customer. I'm tech-savvy. I know what I'm doing. There's something wrong with the CD. It's nothing that I am doing wrong. Trust me. PK: Okay. Do you mind going to ""My Computer"" for me? ST: Fine. Just give me one minute. I'm telling you now that this is a waste of time. The CD is broken. *I hear clicking but now she isn't saying anything* PK: Did you get that pulled up? ST: Yes I am looking thru the folders to see if I can find anything with the applications name on it but there is nothing here. PK: if you can please go back for me to the main page where you can see all the drives and let me know when you're there so I can instruct you further. ST: Fine... *More clicking and silence* PK: Did you get there? ST: Well..... for some reason I can't see the computer button so I don't know what's going on. Maybe it's the computer that's broken. PK: It's probably not broken. Sounds like you probably have Windows 7, I get this question a lot. If you click on the Start button you will find the Computer option on the right... ST: Okay. I got it now... *Click Click Click* PK: Before you start jumping around can I get you to please go back to you home page that shows all the drives? ST: Fine..... I am there now. PK: Okay. Can you right click on the D drive and select open. ST: Yep... nothing there! It's empty. This CD is broken! I told you it was! PK: Your positive the CD is in the drive? ST: Yes! It's in there! I tested this earlier today and I couldn't get it to work and I left it in there for this call. PK: Do you mind taking it out and putting it back in for me? ST: Fine. I am telling you that it's a problem with the CD and that you will just need to send...............Oh. The CD wasn't in the drive. After she found the CD and put it in the application did not automatically launch so I did have to walk her through opening the drive in the My Computer menu again and downloading it that way. I couldn't help but laugh to myself at how many times this lady repeated the phrase ""I'm tech-savvy"" to me. TL;DR: Customer tells me CD isn't working and she is Tech-savvy so she knows it's nothing she did wrong and that the CD is broken.

We spent all day looking for her dog, and we actually found it! Our basset found the little guy in a rabbit den of all things, so we thought that he must have gotten cold and crawled inside the small space to get warmed up and then was too tired to make his way home.

Therapy is helping. But a five year relationship died that day. And I miss it, but I'm not sure I miss her anymore. Her addiction and alcoholism played a major role in her choice and feelings. She had, apparently, been using for a few months and kept it hidden. If you need help quitting heroin, go find it. It fucks up more than just your life.

uid_180954,Coffee I hope one day to buy you a beer.,2015-01,0,"This is a somewhat complex topic but I'll report the trends that I've seen. First of all, the decline of mainline denominations can be more or less directly correlated with the adoption of birth control. In other words, the mainlines decline is a demographic problem: low fertility rates. The decline of conservative churches has lagged behind the mainline largely because they adopted birth control later than the mainline. However, we are now seeing similar data from conservative churches. Fertility rates have now largely leveled off in The Episcopal Church so in the near future we can expect the demographics to also level off. In other words, when people report that TEC is doomed if current membership decline continues they are talking nonsense, there is no reason to expect membership to decline at the same rate indefinitely. The other major loss in membership is due to schism. This too can largely be expected to be a finished problem. The particularly contentious issues of inclusion of women and gays is largely behind us. In other words those who are going to leave over that issue have pretty much already done so. I think it is obvious that the way forward is to try to reconcile as best we can. The danger for TEC is that the National Church continues to 'progress' beyond the tolerance of the moderates who have stayed. I am optimistic this won't happen as it seems the next generation of Episcopalians, while affirming the rights of women and gays, also hold to a deeply orthodox view of the creeds, sacraments, and scripture. Finally, there is the issue of the growing secularization of society and the marginalization of the Church. In many ways, there isn't really much that we can do about this. The Church has been here before in history and likely will be here again in the future. The Church can, however, decide how it will adapt. Personally I think the Church will contract but also deepen. In other words, those who still feel drawn to God (and there will always be some) will hopefully find a close knit, spiritual community that is committed to living out God's will in ways that will seem weird and radical to others. For an example of this I would look into the Benedict Option.",2,2,Anglicanism,KiOulixeus,0

What's yours? **My endgame**: *get my favorite chars to lvl 50, true pirate wep, full oathbreaker accessories and play arena pvp only.* I love the arena pvp system in this game. Started with destro, now going with summoner and thinking about KFM, I also have a warlock and FM. I do dailies with Summoner/Warlock, and enjoy arena with destro. This game is a massive time sink, if you want to keep up with the pve content you have to treat it like a job. Some people say it's like a part-time job, but I think if you would have a hard time maxing your char out if you treated it as a full time job. Personally, I love the game for it's character creation, storytelling, costumes, and pvp. I am sure that no one enjoys wasting time on dailies, over and over again, every single fucking day. Some famous streamers also said that they've given up on the PVE content, such as Jaesung, and I realized that it's not worth investing that much time into this game. It would arguably be better to invest real money, saving you time and letting you enjoy the game for it's pve content without grinding your brains out. The new 6v6 dungeons are rubbish, the whole concept destroys the esports aspect of the game. As a proper csgo player, following most of the popular esports, the fact that BnS was huge as an esport was what drew me in to try this game, but now it's obvious that the game will die soon, just like NCSofts other projects, such as Lineage2 did. I see people in my clan grinding for 18 hours non-stop for some idiotic silverfrost quartz, so that they can achieve their ""dream"" of gaining an edge, or at least getting closer to catching up to the most geared people in the server, which will probably not happen. I think all of that is just blatantly stupid, and you need to stop for a moment and think what you're doing to yourself. Many new people come in every day, get mesmerized by this game, and make it their goal to get to the top PVE wise. In my opinion these people are just bad at math, because if you look at all the resources you'll need to get anywhere close to the endgame (time, money, luck, effort, skill), you can easily see that you're making a very bad investment, which will never pay off. For all the people who say ""I enjoy gear progression, who are you to tell me what I like or dislike, it's like fishing, just a hobby man, it brings me joy"" ok you can continue deluding yourself, I can only address people who are good at math and not randoms who like torturing themselves in front of a monitor. /rant I know my end goals, but I've always wondered what other people want from this game.

uid_898070,What the hell are you talking about,2016-08,0,"Conspiracy Theory on Marvel's civil wars We're now getting Civil War II and will soon get Inhumans vs X-Men. This follows on the heels of Avengers v X-Men, and ultimately the original Civil War. And that's just the headline events; hero-versus-hero fights have been, to a greater or lesser extent, a fixture of Marvel since the beginning of that universe, and (at least recently) it's been less a matter of ""fight and then team up against the villain that set you up to fight"" and more straight-up hero against hero, until only one is left standing. DC generally reserves *that* for Elseworlds. And that gives rise to an idea. Who gains from those heroic civil wars? The villains, for one, at least those whose goals are something besides revenge or profit. But also the government. What happens if you don't have inter-hero conflict, if the heroes stand as a united front against evil? You get the Justice League, in one of its bigger incarnations. And the DCU government, to a great extent, has exactly as much power as the League allows it to have. When push comes to shove, a united superhumanity is sufficient to overthrow the government if necessary - and because of that, it will never become necessary. Power ultimately lies with the League. So what do you do to save democracy, if you're its SHIELD? You need to, simply put, prevent the Trinity or an equivalent from forming as unbreakable friends and leaders. And so you provoke civil war after civil war, aiming to splinter the superheroic community. Aiming to engineer long-lasting mass hatred towards only limited sections of that community - those with the X-gene, say - to make it clear that they're not all the same. And you need to do this entirely in secret. Because, if you don't, and the villains don't win, a Justice League equivalent will form; and if it does, sooner or later democracy will die. (Superman's response, aside from pointing out the hypocrisy? That, first of all, a republic being the optimal form of government is theorem, not axiom, and a theorem derived from axioms some of which superhumans violate. But also that the Justice League is, yes, only a metastable equilibrium. But that this centralized superhuman bloc is desirable precisely for that reason. The goal is to lead humanity into the light, but equality must not be reached by making everyone mortal, but by making everyone divine. By making everyone super, not by making no one super - and yes, those are two quite different things.)",0,0,comicbooks,MetalOcelot,0

A husband, his wife, and their small child. Not getting out of this car that's very clearly overheating and still running. Nope, they're just chillin' inside. Obviously, we realize this isn't a smart move, so we grab some fire extinguishers and head over there. By the time we get to the car, flames are starting to lick out from underneath the hood. We instruct the husband to get his wife and kid out of the car. He looks at us, confused, but eventually does what we say after about the fifth or sixth time we ask. We extinguish the flames just as the fire department arrives. We offer to keep the car on our lot for the day, until the tow truck comes to pick it up.

uid_949756,Ultima Online had a very similar mechanic that I absolutely loved.,2016-03,0,"Thoughts on The Best RPG Progression Mechanic (And Your Examples?) Hi all! Let me preface that I am not a gamedev, but a Let's Player. That said, I wanted to check with you guys regarding a particular RPG progression style that I've seen very little of, but absolutely love. **Quest 64** got generally mediocre reviews, but I LOVED that game. The game itself was definitely rough around the edges, but the progression system was so satisfying that I've circled back to the game many times (and even played through the mostly terrible GBA port, Brian's Quest), and have always been on the lookout for games with a similar progression mechanic. In short, your skills level up as you use them in more or less real time (stats can be upgraded mid-battle, though new spell points could only be spent at the end of a battle). Every time you attack, you get some agility and regain 1 MP. Every time you cast a spell, you get some magic casting XP and progress towards an expanded MP pool. Every time you soak a hit, you get a bit towards expanding your health pool and increasing your defenses. To me, this is perhaps *the most satisfying implementation of RPG progression* that I've experienced in a game. In particular, the game became extremely fun to me when you had enough HP/Def to soak hits such that you could heal that HP back with a heal spell, and regen your MP with melee attacks. Outside of battle, you regained an MP with each ~1 second of walking. Once this was mostly sustainable, it became super fun to me. Now, on to the questions: * Are you aware of any other games with this type of progression? * What are your thoughts on this type of progression? Somehow, this is massively more satisfying than your standard grindy MMORPG, but I can't figure out why. * I want to play the crap out of games that mimic this mechanic closely. This is not a question, but it's the stone-cold truth nonetheless. Cheers! ~Morjax",1,1,gamedev,miketomjohn,0

uid_686834,Get gud,2015-03,0,"Any tips for a frustrated returning player? I've always loved Dark Souls and Dark Souls 2, and I've gotten back into the sequel recently after a few months away from the series. The first game drastically lengthened my notoriously short fuse, but when I stopped playing, it eventually went back to being shorter than my shoelace. For the record, I don't wear shoes with laces. In an attempt to get back into DS2 and finally finish my first playthrough (Over a year after I bought the game, mind you), I made myself ingame (I'm currently wearing the Alva set with the Drangleic shield and a +5 Broadsword for reference). I managed to almost get to the Last Giant before my first death on the other side of the Cardinal Tower wall, trying to get the firebomb- chucking Hollow to blow up the powder barrels. I succeeded at getting shortcut open and proceeded onto the Ironclad knight (After dealing with Pate's little trap room with the Hollow ganksquad), where I got the other firebomb Hollows to blow him up. I couldn't get away in time, so I died again. At this point, I was slightly peeved at my ineptitude: Normally, I would take out the Hollows, then deal with the knight, but I had forgotten my own technique! I shrugged it off and kept going. When I got to the sword statue, I looted the Halberd with no intention of using it and slid off the ledge while trying to fight the Hollow who had snuck up on me. I yelled at the screen, ""WAIT! NO!"", which turned a few heads in my house. I think now would be a good time to mention that I am 17 years-old and living with my parents. That's going to be important later. I brushed that off and pressed on. After killing the Last Giant and Persuer with almost no effort and good dodging skills (And no, I didn't use the ballista), made my way to the Lost Bastille. I tracked down and took out the Lost Sinner and proceeded to hunt down the rest of the Old Ones. After losing 50, 000 souls in the Iron Keep (While taking out the Old Iron King as the third Old One), I gave up for a week. I was surprised that I hadn't ragequitted yet. The other day, I picked up the game again and took out the Old Iron King after dying a few more excrutuating times to the Ironclad and Alonne Knights. I I went to go take out the Duke's Dear Freja. That was when this story starts having a point. After freeing Rosabeth and opening the door to the Shaded Woods, I was ganked by those poison zombie bastards. After yelling an angry ""DAMMIT!"", I put on my gameface and pressed on. Several curse urns and a Najka bossfight later, I made my way to the cave filled with spiders. The spiders jumped at me, broke my poise, and were incredibly annoying. I ran away to use a lifegem only for the game to flat out not do what I told it to do. I yelled something along the lines of, ""DO IT! DO WHAT I'M TELLING YOU TO DO!"". The game didn't listen and I died. I slammed my fist on my controller in a small rage and for some reason, kept going, frowning a yelling about the smallest things. If an enemy hit me, I yelled for it to stop, died, and raged. If I died, I yelled, complained, and kept getting stressed out. Eventually I made it to Freja, when I totally blew up. The spiders blocked my escape from the boss's laser attack. I yelled, ""SPIDERS, GET OUT OF THE WAY!"" I died, punched my controller again, slammed it on the sofa, and stopped for the day at my Mom's order. I researched the fight that night. Cut to yesterday. I summoned Boyd to help me deal with the boss, and I killed it. After getting the last Great Soul, I made my way to Drangleic Castle. At this point, I am still using the Drangleic Shield and Broadsword. I tried to kill the soldiers at the gate only to be combo'd to death with the help of the Mastadons. I yelled some more and slammed my controller AGAIN. My Mom told me to stop and take a walk around the block. I told her no, put my gameface on and tried again. I almost got combo'd to death again, but managed to roll back to the bridge. I stopped to use a lifegem. A crossbow bolt shot my right in the face and I died. I snapped. I yelled and screamed about crossbows, and upon respawing, went into a rant. My mom turned to face me in her chair, but I didn't pay attention. My raving was stopped abruptly by my mom slamming her hands on her desk repeatedly, standing up, screaming at me, and tossing things across room. She stormed away to the kitchen to get a drink and calm her nerves. My dad came it and gave me a death glare. I got up and left the house in a hurry. I haven't even touched my console since, not even to turn it off. This is the culmination of all of my actions so far. My whole family is pissed off at me and my mom refuses to reply to anything I say beyond basic sentences. But I didn't come here for family help. It will all blow over eventually, I can deal with it. I need help with the game itself. I know that my attitude is the problem. Instead of trying to lengthen my fuse again, I'm trying to get through a notoriously difficult game with only a mind for progress. It's not about the fun anymore, it's about progress an getting to the next area. When I encounter resistance, whether it be a difficult boss or just an annoying room, and die, my temper flares up. Recently, I can only take about 2, maybe 3 deaths before I violently ragequit. I need to slow down and learn more patience, but I'm having a hard time dealing with the smallest amount of annoyance. Tips about the game itself or how to improve my attitude are all welcome. Also, what are some of your worst DS2 experiences? How did you all deal with it?",3,3,DarkSouls2,Scaveola,1

I was a lurker until now, watching the fanbase making theories, artwork, and Scott pumping out the games, until now. I have made an account for this project, and maybe future use for communication with the subreddit. Honestly, the story has become so complicated it's stressful. I want to bring the good old days back with a remaster of the first game. Now, I don't want to release a free version of the first game, so I will expand on it, but not too much. It will feature something from all the games in the franchise. The game's lore will be solvable without the need of another game, but it won't be as simple. Cutscenes or minigames might be present. I'm working on this myself. It will be made in Clickteam Fusion, and there isn't gonna be any teasers. The original game didn't have any. I will make a trailer however and submit the game to gamejolt soon. ~ Your newbie SideCracked",1,1,fivenightsatfangames,FNAFessional,0

My degree, political science, was not very lucrative and I had always wanted to go to law school. I then received a 1/2 scholarship to a mediocre law school and eventually received additional merit scholarships, making my 3L year free. I lived at home throughout the duration of law school to save costs, accruing $57,000.00 in loans. I graduated in 2011, the bottom of the worst legal job market in history. I graduated without a job (1400 people applied for 40 spots with my county District Attorney). I worked part time (i.e., 4-6 days a month) as an appearance attorney, making only enough money to cover the payments on the 25 extended payment plan (i.e., essentially interest only). I finally found full time work at the end of 2012, with a firm that would pay me to train and learn the law, salary of $60,000.00 for 3.5 months. That firm let me go, but in the interim I built up some savings. I was then unemployed for six weeks, but had 3.5 months experience under my belt competing with applicants of 3-5 years experience. I then found a job through a recruiter with a smaller firm, but still at $60k / yr. After nine months into my position with firm #2, they bumped me to $100,000.00 per year and I am now just over a year with them. Throughout the duration of my unemployment/underemployment/employment, I have been lucky to live at home with my folks. All my excess money has gone to service the loans and I just recently cut a check for the final $15,000.00 total payment. Now, the next step is to build my savings, fund my retirement (which I have done each of the years I was getting a paycheck), and get away from the parentals' house. I have been incredibly lucky to find a lucrative job (that I like a little bit) and to have parents letting me ride rent free for a bit, but goddamn, does it feel good to be done with the loan payments.",-1,-1,personalfinance,weks,0

I did a big clean sweep of the place, figuring I might as well clean the damn apartment and surely the headphones would show up. They didn't. The next day, she came over to visit me. At one point I was in the shower. The next day after that, I found the headphones in my warddrobe, mixed in with some clothes tussled around. Now, let me say with 1000% certainty: they were not there before. She put them there. She ""planted"" the headphones there to make it look like I'd missed them. But she didn't realise I'd taken every single item of clothing out and *the headphones were not there*. The question is: why the fuck did she not own up and say ""oops, I took them by accident!"", or ""oops, I found them in my bag, I'll bring them back tomorrow"".

She chose to pretend she did not have them, then put them right back where she knew I'd see them and think ""d'oh! how could I have missed that!"" She has no reason to try to fuck with my head.

My next batch is going to be Charolette, Ludmille, Ceres, Leo, and Bartz. Anytime I have to farm an exploration for mats and/or progress in content, I always use my leveling team. And when I find my NGR full and have to waste it quickly, I'll just do int vortex for mats or adv vortex for leveling. What about you guys/gals?",1,1,FFBraveExvius,HappyLittleRadishes,0

I've watched and rewatched the fight between Vegetto and Zamasu plenty of times now, as it's my favorite sequence so far in *Super*. One thing that always strikes me as interesting is the Final Kamehameha at the end of their fight (before Vegetto defuses). When Merged Zamasu emerges from the smoke, he seems unscathed by the blast, which, as Kaioshin points out, contained pretty much the rest of Vegetto's energy. However, Future Trunks, who is *far* below SSB Vegetto, regardless of his Super Saiyan Rage and the Spirit Bomb Sword (or whatever that's going to be dubbed), managed to slice right through Merged Zamasu. I already realize I'm looking far too into this, but I wanted to provoke some discussion since the actual episode discussion has long passed. Is it ambiguous? My idea (which to me, makes the most sense) is that the Final Kamehameha *did* hit Merged Zamasu, weakened him by far, and allowed Future Trunks to slice through him. And yes, I do realize that Goku and Vegeta also gave energy to the damned thing, but they were badly injured at that point. Also, in terms of power, how would you rank Goku, Vegeta and Trunks this arc? And how close do you guys think SSB Vegetto is to, say, Beerus and Whis? There's only mere speculation at this point, but I would wager SSB Vegetto is *far* from either of them.",49,-1,dbz,GeneralPickaxe,0

Prices basically breakdown to $2500 a year for coverage with a $5000 deductible for any actual care or testing. Or $5000 a year for reasonable deductibles. If you get government stipends it should be much cheaper, but if you're middle class you probably will not qualify. In addition there is ZERO consideration for current financial situation outside how many family members you have. If you're in massive debt already to loans/creditors, but pass the basic income to not get a stipend, you're still up shit creek. Most of middle class people can't go taking $5000 financial burdens on without significant life changes or taking on significant debt. The same problems will certainly persist, I'm not going to be rushing off to get any healthcare unless it is a life or death situation, and my hesitation to do so will likely cause more health problems and in the end cost more for my care.

I have this horrible habit of becoming very anxious for parties, then when they come, I get liquid courage in me and things seem fine. This saturday, I'm going to a house party with my girlfriend, we're both 21, but all her friends are 20, some 21. I'm not sure the size of the party, but sizable, and supposedly everyone is sleeping there including my girlfriend and I. My worries are guys hitting on her and how to deal with it. Never been in that situation really, I would like to think I'd handle it maturely and she'd probably just tell them she's with me as I'd probably be standing right there with her. We talked about my insecurity about that (I know, not sexy) but I just said like ""I know you love me but I just have anxiety about these things"" she just said ""Just keep being awesome and you won't have to worry"" jokingly. She just says stuff like it won't happen and it never does. Her and I typically blend in and are fairly shy but still a worry of mine. My other concern is the sleeping arrangement, I have this fear we will all be sleeping on top of each other and it'll be super uncomfortable. I asked what we were doing she said if I don't drink we could just go back to her house and sleep there but she doesn't want to do that and that being the answers to all my fears, I'm still not going to be selfish and ruin a party she wants to be apart of. Come sunday, we will be cuddling and relaxing so I guess I have that to look forward to. All in all, I am 90% sure I will have a good time.

Action figures, balls, frisbees, rackets, etc. Them throwing them over don't even really bother me that much. What bothers me is that the parents keep demanding that we have to throw them back. They don't ask, they don't knock on the door and apologize, they just yell over there fence when they know that we are outside and TELL us to give it back. And that bothers me. They also seem to encourage their kids to throw it over to our yard. So after Christmas I was at the store and saw that they had a ton of Barbie's, nail polish, Bratz doll frisbees, and balls on the clearance. I bought 5 of everything I could find that I knew my neighbors would hate seeing their sons play with. Every time an action figure gets thrown over to my yard, I will throw a barbie back with it. Every time a ball gets thrown, a Bratz ball will be returned. I already threw a couple nail polishes over and the twins went crazy. They loved it. They've had pink, purple, and green nails all week.

Basically, about 20 years after abortions were made legal and accessible, the crime rate dropped drastically. This is because mothers that are ""forced"" (literally by laws, or through social pressure, or lack of alternatives) to give birth, end up being terrible parents, or we people who weren't in a position to be a good parent in the first place. They then contrasted with a study of (I forget where I will look it up, russia..?) a place where not only abortion was made illegal, but women were forced to be impregnated and to give birth to as many children as they could. Twenty years later, worst out breaks of crime imaginable. I bring this up not to say, abortion is great, but because there are ""benefits"" to having abortion legal for everyone, not just those in those instances you mention. Which would lead me to want to ask you, why do you think aborting an embryo that is less than three weeks old is ""wrong"" or ""bad"" or ""immoral""? Nothing is guaranteeing that it will make it full term, in fact there is still over a 40 percent miscarriage rate in even the most developed areas. Until two months, there are more cells in a fly's brain then in an embryo, there is no ""person"" there to be found in that mass off cells to even ask if they want to live (if that was magically possible). Is it immediately after conception in your view that it becomes a ""person"", a few hours, a week? I mean a embryo isn't even distinguishable as a human embryo (exactly the same as all other mammals) until just before two months. I just really don't understand the argument people make, unless its a religious argument (which I don't know if yours is) but I reject that as not being something you should impose on people who don't share the belief because well.. that religion hasn't been shown to be true (because none have) so why should rules be based on it.

You have to wait for it to randomly appear and it removes all element of agency from the player.

There is just no plausible way she can skirmish in a 1v1 setting and come out on top.

uid_267577,Em G D A I dont think theres ever been a famous chord sequence off those four,2015-04,0,"In a rut? Try the 4 note riff challenge! Hey guys! I see a lot of posts about people who get stuck in a creative rut with their soloing or rhythm playing. I myself have struggled with this. Most of the time, I find my riffs sound stale because I phrase everything the same way and after a while, it gets old. Anyways, I came up with a cool little exercise that I like to challenge myself with. I'd like to share it with you in the hopes that at least someone will find it useful. Plus, I'd love to see what everyone can come up with. It's called... ### THE 4 NOTE RIFF CHALLENGE **Here's how it works:** 1. pick any 4 notes on the fretboard (only 4!!!) 2. Come up with a riff using only those 4 notes (feel free to use any techniques to embellish it - hammer-on's, pull-offs, slides, pinch harmonics, etc.) 3. Record yourself playing your riff (crappy phone quality is adequate) 4. Share it with us! -or- reply to somebody's riff using the same 4 notes, but phrase it in your own way *** Make sure to either play your 4 notes slowly at the beginning of your recording and/or just type up the notes you used. The end goal is to come up with something cool and a little different that you can use to get out of your rut. If you can write a kickass 4 note riff, you can write a kickass solo! **Let's see what you got!**",1,1,Guitar,SimonCFC,1

Although they operate with relative autonomy from the regime their participation in fighting rebel units has reduced the burdon on the increasingly emasculated SAA. Indeed, four years after the conflict began, it is clear that the regime would not have survived and maintained control over large parts of the country without the active participation of militias. Yet, the presence and reliance on militais obfuscates the regime's actual control over the country. The presence of militias throughout the country and the absence of rebel groups in those territories actually reflects the regime's weakness, for its reliance on decntralized, privatized violence has dispersed decision-making power to centers potentially outside of the regime's control. As the SAA contracts further, the army is forced to engage in miltary attacks alongside local and regional militias. Such reliance on militias that are outside of the immediate command and control of the regime implies a withering, not a strengthening, of the regime. 116 - The Syrian regime has been forced to rely on privatized and civilianized forms of violence to maintain its military capabilities and its ability to hold contested territory. The SAA has been gutted of personnel, with defections rampant and many syrians avoiding being conscripted at all costs. During the conflict, more than 40,000 SAA fighers are believed to have lost their lives and many regime loyalists from across Syria's sectarian mosaic have begun to openly question and challenge the utility of sending soldiers to their deaths. Such discord among loyalists has been a sensitive issue in Syria and has placed tremendous pressure on the regime. The combination of low military morale, rampant defections, loyalist discord about rising deaths, disintegration within its ranks, and mistrust among SAA soldiers have all forced the regime to turn to civilian or non-Syrian violent actors. ... Throughout Syria, The NDF elite are emerging as a conglomeration of warlords with their own agendas and interests that may or may not coincide with those of the Assad regime in the future. 117 - The phenomenon of warlords is not exclusive to the non-regime areas. The emergence of warlords and this particular architecture of violence in Syria has contributed to the regime's withering and their loss of decision-making power during the course of the conflict.",6,6,syriancivilwar,Bertanx,0

We already know in Year Two that your 365 weapons will have a purpose at the start of the content, but as it progresses they'll lose their usefulness (I've always imagined 365 means it's effective against level 36 enemies just like 300 was effective against 30 enemies but that could be me talking shit). Anyway, these are things we need to know.. Etheric Light - What purpose will it have? Is there any point in me burning Prison for more? I've got 12 right now and all 3 of my characters have maxed VoG armour and Crota, all the weapons I want are 365. So, are these going to grant a purpose or should I just leave Prison as it is now? Exotic shards - Attack upgrades are no more, we know that. So, what use is the shard? I'd presume it'll be to Ascend them to Year Two status as that may just be a thing, but some of us are sat on 50+ shards? Weapon Cores &amp; Armour Cores - I don't know anyone who's not swimming in Weapon Cores at the least. Armour, less, but still a few. So, what purpose could these serve? The weapons have rotated fully now and armour as well, so what can I do with the 12 weapon cores I have? Crux of Crota - This still drops even if you've had it and Nechro'd your Ally. So, could it once again serve a use as a consumable in the Dreadnaught? We're back in Hive territory so I don't see why Oryx' weapons couldn't use the Crux of Crota or it could become relevant? That way, Crota's End becomes relevant once more and people have a reason to run it.",1,1,DestinyTheGame,The_Rick_14,0

I have a professional career, but my house is not paid off and neither is my car. Fortunately I do not have any college debt thanks to a very generous public education system. Why do I see myself as rich? Because I probably have more in assets and lifestyle than 95% of the global population. For all I know, I might even be doing better than 99% of the rest of the world. That does NOT mean I am even in the top 20% in the United States, where I live. But I understand I don't just have to look at my immediate neighbors (who might not think *they're* rich) to realize how well off I am. I have health insurance, home insurance, car insurance, and a few others. I could survive for some time if I suddenly lost my ability to earn a living, and considering how wealthy my state/country is, I could survive beyond my own means for some time beyond that. This security is much greater ""wealth"" than most people in most nations can even approach, and it is even despite the horrific costs of our healthcare system. I am also years away (probably) from worry about whether I would have enough healthy food to eat, and clean water is basically free. And since we're talking infrastructure, how about easy access to electricity, Internet, and other utilities? I certainly have all of these, even if I didn't have contracts to bring them into my home. In light of all this, I consider myself more than lucky, even blessed, to be so wealthy. Hopefully I donate enough (for at least I can), and hopefully I help others enough (at what point can I be satisfied that I am doing enough?). I am happy to pay the taxes I pay, and I am moderately okay with it even if they were raised some. ""Sharing the wealth"" via government is not a bugaboo to me. The best thing: having once been below the poverty line, I regularly think about how nice good food tastes, even if it is like a roast chicken or a good cup of coffee. These are luxuries. The worst thing: I am beginning to see other family members start to think of my financial stability as reasons to mention their own needs (thinking somehow we might share some with them). It is a new thing to deal with, and also hard not to be affected by it. Hopefully I will be able to avoid the temptation to think somehow I wound up ""better"", when really I just found a way to somewhat better circumstances for now.

Mind you I've been a contractual employee or self employed for years, so I generally have a viking beard, hair down to the middle of my back, and I often wear combat boots and band shirts. I'm assuming that I somehow radiate an aura of responsibility, confidence, or sage-like knowledge that they mistake for authority. Now, if it were an anomaly that only happened once in my life, that would be one thing, but oddly it seems to happen about once every few months. I'll be doing my shopping, and someone will approach me and ask for assistance, or where a product is. If it's something simple, like reaching for something that a shorter customer cannot reach, I'll do it, even though I'm a few inches shorter than 6 ft. However, after having dealt with two incidences of indignation, I decided that perhaps the best way to deal with irate customers is to have a little fun. The two incidences that lead me to this decision were a fellow customer cursing me out for not ""going in the back"" to check on a large screen television for him (mind you this was at a store where the employees are all well groomed, wear blue shirts and khaki pants, and I'm dressed like Rob Zombie), and a woman at a bookstore complaining because *""an employee should know the newest release on Oprah's book club""*. These happened within two weeks of one another, and both times I simply stood there, chuckling. So, I decided the best way to deal with such people is to perform my ""job"" in such a way that would assuredly get me ""fired"", or at least result in hilarity. A few times it's just been directing customers to non-existent departments, such as the ""German"" department in Walmart when a customer was looking for clock radios, or the ""Apparel"" department in an electronics store when a customer was looking to speed up their computer (*""Sir, you're going to need more RAM, you'll find it right next to the headlight fluid and the waffles.""*) Although, to be honest, the best had to be when some obvious soccer mom was asking me for a cook book, and I told her that the best one I ever found was *""120 Days of Sodom""* by the Marquis deSade.

uid_642612,There's this Ukrainian kid that I hear is super friendly and an overall great teammate that would make your CS:GO experience amazing!,2016-05,0,"Fairly new to CS, looking for friendly people to play with. Hi guys. First off as a TL;DR, the title pretty much says it all. So to go into a little more depth: I'm a 21 year old Brit who's been interested in CSGO for a few years now. Started mostly watching tournaments and never really playing the game. Now I've played almost 300 hours, most of which I'd spent on training_aim_csgo and death matches, but constantly changing my settings so that my practice was never really all too fruitful. It's mostly been a game that I just pick up every so often, do a death match here or there and put down again. However, I actually really want to get good at CSGO. I'm not entirely sure what it is about the game but having watched people like KennyS and his almost inhuman reaction times, or how people like Olof and Fnatic as a whole, I can't help but sit in awe at the infinite skillcap this game has. So recently I've taken a step back and have changed all my settings to something I've felt comfortable with and have been forcing myself not to change things and I've been trying to incorporate CSGO into my daily routine so that I get consistent practice. I've mostly been playing on things like headshot only pistol death matches, a few awp servers and some other random things I've found on the community servers here or there. Last night for example, I was playing with a group on a server and someone asked what rank people were. It turned out there were quite a few DMGs and people around that rank with the 5yr vet coin and I'd held my own against them. I did die quite a bit, I won't deny but a few times there had been clutch situations and I killed their highest fraggers in 1v2 and 1v3 which felt pretty awesome. I've also been playing a lot more of Valve's death match servers and am usually the highest fragger or within the top 3. So basically I'm now sitting here wondering where exactly my skill level actually is. But the thing is I've yet to play any of the casual or competitive mode of the game so as good as my aim might be but probably isn't, I don't really understand the game's economy, when to and not to buy (although I've watched WarOwl's series on this, I've yet to practice it), callouts/place names and really just playing the game with a team. I read recently that casual really isn't a good game mode for people wanting to get into competitive. It's too lenient, you don't have to buy armour which effectively changes the way pistol rounds are played, no team fire or collision or anything of that sort so I'm feeling inclined to jump directly into competitive. However I know I'll get raged at if I do so without really understanding how the game should be played with outside of death matches and fun servers. None of my friends play the game and constantly refuse to do so whenever I ask them but I'd like to find a group of people I could play with fairly regularly so that I can get used to and learn the game in a nice environment. If you're much better than me, that'd help too because really, the only way to get better is to play people who shit on you until you learn, adapt and start holding your own.",11,11,GlobalOffensive,chrisfps7,1

The still small voice kept telling me, ""you're in a hurry; your parking meter may run out"". But I didn't want to be a jerk to these earnest kids. About 20 seconds of polite conversation about why I'm not interested in their message revealed that these baby faced hunters and fishers of the Lord knew not about a) Joseph Smith's polygamy/child brides, b) the seer stone method of translation, or c) the basic Egyptian funerary text content of the facsimilies. In my heart of hearts I knew that I needed to keep walking, but it seemed rude to recite a laundry list of doctrinal//historical issues, drop the mic, and walk away, so I chatted with them for a couple of minutes as I tried to politely end the conversation and work my way back to my car. Lo and behold, when I got to my car there was a meter cop tucking a ticket under my windshield wiper, just as 'the spirit' had suggested to me there would be. I'd like to bear my testimony that this church is not true. I know that the spirit of rational thought is there to guide me through my days as long as I don't allow my judgment to be clouded by sentimental affection toward hapless Mos. I know that if we heed the promptings of rational thought, we can live happier lives, free from the needless suffering that happens when we succumb to the outwardly friendly face of the church and get sucked into its toxic culture and insane doctrine.

I was personally thinking if her trap could be placed at a range comparable to her 3 or something. that way she could actively use it on an enemy god compared to leaving them out to zone or needing set up to use it. Other things I've seen around this sub before were to change her passive to have her power increase by 5% or something each time she gets a crit for 2-3 seconds and it stacks 3 times or something. Then just give her passive 15% crit. (i'm pulling these numbers from nowhere just focus on the general idea) make it so her traps give vision but at half the range or something of normal wards. I see where this idea is coming from. wards win games. But I dont know how to feel about it and dont know how helpful it'll be towards getting to late game. Like is the money you save on wards really going to add up that much make her 3 cripple for 2 seconds so she can use her ult and not worry about people getting out of range like the way hou yi does.

uid_776254,What keeps me here: Drama,2016-02,0,"What got you into Starcraft? What keeps you into Starcraft? I always knew of and had a healthy respect for Starcraft, being one of the first games to become an e-sport. I didn't get into Starcraft until mid 2015. I was browsing Twitch late night and saw a GSL group stage. I had no idea what was going on, but I was intrigued. Tastosis had hooked me with their humour and excitement, watching GSL quickly became a late night tradition. Eventually I moved onto trying to play, watching old Day 9 dailies and becoming completely enthralled in Starcraft. It was a huge serotonin drip playing what I thought was the hardest game in the world and constantly improving. Improvement was slow but steady, I took Day9's cue and celebrated the little improvements. I have a HoTS replay titled ""Gosu Macro"" where I keep my macro together for 3 minutes, a gigantic achievement at the time. My beginning goal of reaching Grandmaster league was realistically adjusted to reaching Masters league. A year later and thousands of games in I'm mid Diamond and I'm quickly approaching my goal. The rate of improvement has slowed considerably but I'm improving nonetheless. As I approach my goal I'm a bit burnt out and finding it rather difficult muster up any excitement. I get to Masters league, but then what? Create a new goal of reaching Grandmaster? It seems like a pointless never-ending treadmill. To be honest I'm not sure if I have that much fun playing Starcraft anymore. The entire endeavour of a Starcraft game is incredibly stressful and I'm only truly happy when I win and it's over. Right now my Starcraft future is uncertain, LOTV is an absolutely amazing game. The problem is I'm not sure if I possess the ability or the drive to gain the ability to play it properly. Properly meaning playing at a high enough level that reflects the amount of time and effort I've put into the game. So my Starcraft friends, I ask you, what keeps you into Starcraft? High level players in Masters and GM, players that have been in the same league season after season. What drives you to keep playing the game? Also what got you into Starcraft? I'm sure that will be pretty useful information for those looking to get more people into Starcraft.",2,2,starcraft,YellyBeans,1

Ignorant, ungrateful, unforgiven. Everything what questions the so called 'collective mind' or does not looks like a good idea will be downvoted into oblivion by a cluster of bandwagon. Remember one of these people who are frustrated about Hero League or Team League? Just downvote this f* noob because we have the power to judge him. Or this person who does NOT play the build you play with your fav. chara. Just downvote him, because it makes more sense to disagree with a silent treatment instead talking this out and allow new insights. Or that person, who disagree with a 'pro' because he can tell how bad he plays a character. Ditto goes for the tierlists. Your individuality is worthless as long as you are not a well-known person. Many known people in the scene exploit this on purpose because they're on a pro team or have to say something. This makes their opinion automatically better than yours. But you, you don't deserve anything. Open your mouth and we will downvote you unless you make a very good post - but still, it doesn't matter. I will downvote you just for the sake of disagreement that you ever thought in this direction. My personal suggestion would be to lay down and not try to understand this mentality. You cannot change people, they will never try to understand you and of course never change as long you're not on the top of the food chain. This is how reddit works in very competitive subreddits like hots, lol and many other games. The mods made also a statement to these downvotes and it has been said that they cannot change the system. People are going to be jerks, no matter what. It's more a psychological problem what questions the inner desire of these people.

We have gone out roughly 10 times and we both have great times. We go out for dinner and drinks, just drinks, shes met my friends, and I've met hers twice. She made me dinner and drinks last night and it all went well. We tend to enjoy our alone time vs being with friends. We both have agreed on that. It feels like a girlfriend. Everything in that aspect seems to be perfect or damn near close. The problem is physical. After our third date she told me she had been raped before and that since that happened, a year and a half ago, she has not been able to be with a guy. She said even getting close to a guy has been really hard. I understood this, she has a damn good reason too. Not a deal breaker to me and I'm really not in a rush for any reason. I am willing to go forward, she said I could leave if I ever felt it to be much. I find her very attractive and shes suggested similar thoughts in regards to me. I have been patient but it has been about a month and she doesn't even let me give her hugs. I am not a gross or smelly person or anything of that sort. I've tried to kiss her but she was stand offish there as well. I honestly, even though it seriously sounds like it, don't think I am in the friend boat. Maybe I am blind? I mean if she wont give me a hug she has some problems with her past still constantly in her head. It is just a hug. I hug my friends male or female with no issues.. I am currently placing the problem to be on her past issues and her trying to get over it. I don't need the physical aspect TODAY. I want to be there for her, I find her mind even more attractive than what I see phsyically. I love to talk to her and just hang out etc, but eventually I think every healthy relationship needs the passion of a phsyical relationship. I guess the question is what do I do? I know I cant force her to speed up her recovery. It I think is too early for me to push her to talk about it or to talk to someone else about it. Anyone have any advice, or questions?

Yet the British Empire hung on, ebbing and flowing, but overall in decline, until after WWII. I'd say the beginning of the fall of the US empire was in the early 1970s. That's when the purchasing power of the American people peaked, and that's when the US, so bankrupt from the debt of the war on Vietnam, had to detach the US dollar from the gold standard. Though we've ebbed and flowed since then, US economic power has been in pretty much continual decline, Reagan's trade policies turning us into a debtor country in the 1980s, and only the power vacuum of the breakup of the USSR making the US seem hyper-powerful. The exact end may indeed be quite quick, especially since we've been in decline for so long.

In any kind of negotiations, whether it's business or political, it's important to know what your value may be your opponent, and what's something that they will not accept. And the yahoos did things that is not acceptable to Beijing, and are seen to be advancing the Taiwan separatism cause. I'm not making judgement whether Taiwan should or should not be separate, but HK's value to Beijing is to demonstrate that one country two system could work. And now they want help from their Colonial overlords, and forgetting that they have no value to the British. It's 7 million people on a tiny speck on this earth. It's not like the Brits have a base, or the GCHQ is in Tamar. What could the Hong Kongers offer to the British that would make them do anything more than pay the occasional lip service? This is aside from the fact that they themselves are mired in Brexit, which if that goes through, they're likely to face calls of separation from the Scots and reunification for Ireland.

Argued with parents, still won at least So I was talking with my parents recently and they started bothering me about the fact that I'm not seeing anyone (again). Now, I'm very busy in college: I'm double-majoring in physics and electrical engineering, trying to keep up a 3.75 GPA so I can go to graduate school, my GREs are looming over me like some malevolent beast, I'm taking 19 credits and holding not one but two jobs, I'm involved in sports, I'm the president of the Society of Physics Students chapter on campus and involved heavily in another (math team). It's not that I have no interest in dating, I've said repeatedly that if I met someone who I thought was really interesting I'd make time, but unless she's hiding in a textbook or a computer lab I'm probably not going to be meeting her for the time being. Anyway. They then told me that if I don't ""develop those skills"", I won't find someone ""before it's too late"". Ignoring the blatant intrusion into my personal life, I asked ""Too late for what?"" (knowing the answer, of course) to which they told me that if I married ""too late"" we wouldn't have enough time for children. To which I said, no problem, I don't ever plan on having any. And then they flipped out. The first thing they said (and this is where I got mad) was that I need to stop being such an ""overachieving perfectionist"", because it's caused me to place my ambitions above ""family"", and causing me to become ""noncommittal to what's really important."" A little interlude. Understand that there are parents the world over who would literally kill for their offspring to be accomplishing what I am now. And they're going to complain that I'm too hard-working? So, really? Noncommittal? Two jobs: tutoring and TA'ing. Research. 19 credits. Engineering and physics. Grad school ambitions. President of a chapter of an academic society. Math team. Sports. Student orchestra. And I'm fucking noncommittal? Just blow me. I have never in my entire life felt so disrespected. I said that that's what's important to me. One day, my family would only be as a couple (and I'm skeptical of marriage too, since in my mind it's a sexist cultural anachronism from a time when women were property, but that's another rant for another day), and that's it. I have no interest in children. Period. Then I got the ""But having a *real* family is part of the human experience!"" Well, first of all, I actually philosophically identify with the transhumanist movement, so I frankly don't care what anyone else says about the ""human experience"", of course I didn't say this so it's neither here nor there. I'll decide for myself what my ""human experience"" will be, thank you. And also, I find it deeply troubling that you say that people without children are not ""real families"". Followed by some assorted ""selfish"" garbage and defaulting to me apparently having been damaged by working too hard in college, at which point they actually seriously threatened to stop paying for me to go to college! Now, ordinarily, that statement would horrify and infuriate me. But in this instance all I could do was laugh. I've consistently maintained a full-ride scholarship as a result of my ""unhealthy perfectionism"". On top of that, legally, the college fund belongs to me anyway and they agreed (by form of a binding contract) that it will fully disburse to me when I graduate so it's not like there's anything they could do even if I didn't have a scholarship. Then a minute of awkward silence on their part and some grumbling about selfishness, ultimately grudgingly telling me they ""respect"" my decision (as if). The important thing is that I won. tl;dr: Parents bingoed me and complain that I'm a perfectionist for not wanting children, get soundly shut down when they started being nasty.",4,4,childfree,thr0wfaraway,1

uid_423139,The average players opinion of fighting tracer: Holy fuck I've never faced such an annoying hero.,2016-04,0,"An average player's first impressions on Tracer Disclaimer: says so right in the title but to make it clear I'm not a pro player and probably not even a ""good"" player. These are my opinions and they are also very early impressions, based mostly on the AI games I played yesterday to try my hand with her. Do comment or debate what I'm saying because that's the point of this post. With that out of the way, a few random thoughts about Tracer: * Boy she's squishy. The pure hp numbers don't translate well into actual combat. Sure, Li Ming has less hp, and Valla/Nova have pretty much the same amount, however they also have the range advantage and are not *forced* by their kits to get into melee range. You'll take a lot of damage even while being careful, your B key will fade from usage. * Playing tracer against AI poses some particular challenges and opportunities, something that will be less pronounced against players (except perhaps very good or very bad ones). First thing is: the AI AA game is top notch. If there are no other nearby heroes, the AI will start AAing you the millisecond you get in range. It's uncanny and also quite deadly for tracer. On the other hand, if you find a bot in ""run"" mode, it's easier than killing a minion as they won't fight you at all, even if they could kill you. And they certainly can't outrun you. * While fun to play, I get the impression she'll be mostly a niche hero in pro play, as there are very few things she does well, while easily becoming a liability if not in very expert hands. * Playing without support is annoying as hell, you'll be hearthing a lot. On the other hand, playing with support (Tassadar in particular) is another matter entirely. That said, a look at the talent choices. **Level 1** At level one I feel that Slipstream is going to be the sensible choice most of the time. Not only the reduced cooldown is nice, but the added second of recall is, I found, crucial. Apparently 3 seconds will put you in harms way, while 4 seconds will leave you in a safe place. Unless you plan on using recall only to dash in, combo, recall out, you should really take this talent. Tracer rounds may have uses in some geometry heavy maps, if it keeps the enemy visible through fog of war. In that case it will help you run down enemy heroes. Pulse Strike seems really underwhelming, with a caveat I'll discuss later at tier 13. **Level 4** This is a tricky level... Is that a health pack will feel needed the first few times you play her. You take so much damage and have so little health that the healing boost seems worthy. While the talent makes the fountains heal you to full, the effect on the globes is frankly barely noticeable. This talent also scales terribly in late game, when you won't be able to use the fountain much and globes won't be as readily as available as before. Untouchable is clear in function however it requires a dedication and skill to pull of for such a limited buff that it seems to me it's going to be extremely difficult to pull off. You simply die too easily and the bonus is only to AA damage (which means your burst potential doesn't actually go up much). Also 15 takedowns is a lot... Now, if it was permanent or permanent after completion it could be worth it... Or maybe a 5% buff per takedown, requiring only 6 takedowns to max, meaning you could still get use out of it even while dying a bit. Parting gift... Well, on paper the damage is nice and could contribute to the burst, however the mechanics of the bomb should be clarified... They don't seem to aim for targets, rather are spread around in a fairly large range, meaning they can be very unreliable. More experiments will need to be done about this. **Level 7** All three options seem somewhat decent. However, having tried a mix of all of them, my guess is Jumper is going to be better on average. Mostly because it gives you more burst and it's more difficult to run out of. Bullet time requires costant use to get a reduction of under 30%. You get faster recovery from a burst, but only if you can constantly AA something. Spatial echo may be situationally useful but Jumper still seems more reliable even in the situations where Spatial echo may be useful. **Level 10** This tier is interesting because unlike other heroes, I have the impression that all three choices are good, in the right situation. Pulse Rounds is probably the ""jack of all trades"". The added range is great for practicing and for hitting enemies that are getting close to their defenses without exposing yourself. The faster charge rate also means that you get to fire the ultimate more often, which is always nice. Quantum spike could see use against some health heavy enemy composition (say, double warrior, azmodans and stuff like that). Unlike the early info, it doesn't seem like it becomes single target anymore, which is great. Also, one interaction that would be nice to test, is how it works against AI targets. In particular, since it doesn't specify ""target hero"" but rather a generic ""primary target"", would sticking it to a target like a punisher/web weaver/garden terror/boss allow it to do a crapload of damage? If that's the case then it could be worth using in the relevant maps. Sticky Bomb usefulness is clear, and definitely best suited against a melee heavy team or in a composition that makes the best out of stacked AoEs (like, moshpit, maw, grav bomb, etc). Could also be situationally useful against runners but in general you don't have trouble keeping up with them. However it may be useful as a sort of peel, when combined with the lvl 20 KB talent. **Level 13** With all discussions about Ricochet, I believe it's not the talent to pick here. And as much as she feels squishy and any bit of healing would help, leeching rounds is not the talent to pick here either (though it could be a bit more arguable if it leeched against any target rather than just heroes). No, the talent to pick here is Bullet Spray. For several reasons: 1) Even though it's late, it gives Tracer the wave clear she sorely lacks for most of the game. Not as important as it would have been before, it's still impactful enough to be worth mentioning. 2) The added burst in teamfights is huge. Melee hits *hard*. The added range also means it's a ^tiny bit less risky to use. 3) This should be tested, as I didn't pay notice BUT: melee wording is ambiguous ""Gain 5% Pulse Bomb charge when damaging an enemy, and 10% against Heroes."". What happens if you hit more than one target? Do you get charge for each? I suspect not, however if you do it's easy to see why this would be an even better talent than it already is. Which brings me back to tier 1... If the charge works indeed like this, the added charge against heroes from the tier 1 talent means that hitting with just one melee 3 heroes (not that difficult unless they are all ranged) would charge your ultimate by 45% rather than 30%. **However** this *must* be tested as atm it's only a wet dream. **Level 16** The second most uninspired tier. Not much to say... If you can reliably hit the reload, go for Locked and Loaded (though I suspect in teamfights it's going to be more difficult). Focus fire is pretty much pointless against minions, though it does work against structures and large targets. It can work against heroes if it doesn't put you out of position (yeah you can move fast but they can delete you with a sneeze). Sleight of Hand is the safest (and smallest buff), though it may edge out focus fire in the long run. **Level 20** I'll say it. Total Recall is useless. It can save you in a pinch, don't get me wrong. But if you take enough damage in 3/4 seconds to make this talent worthwhile, you're probably dead before you can activate it, or you'll end up dead soon thereafter anyway. A small retreat followed by support heals (something you can do without this talent), is going to be almost always better, and you don't have to give up a lvl 20 talent for it. I'm a bit torn here, for a couple of reasons... Composition B is powerful, no doubt about that and regardless of the lvl 10 upgrade you took (though Sticky bombs is going to get the best out of it, due to the early slow and large range. Pulse spike may work if the second bomb gets the damage buff of the first, otherwise it's the worse option for composition B). However I feel Get Stuffed may be better. The reason is that melee does just slightly less damage than the AoE part of pulse bomb. With Get Stuffed you get a 60% boost in uptime for melee, which means more burst and more pulse bomb charge. In fact, if you can reliably melee on cooldown during teamfights, you can get more damage out of get stuffed than on composition B (which, should be pointed out, is also conditional on actually hitting a hero... Not extremely difficult but you *can* miss, or hit minions, or whatever). In the extreme case of having taken Pulse Strike, Bullet spray (and that the charge is per target hit) and Get Stuffed, you could: Run in with full bomb, use it, use melee, get some 45% charge, drop some autoattacks and 5 seconds later run in again, melee and drop a SECOND pulse bomb. That could be some amazing AoE burst potential. Still, even if you can't drop a second pulse bomb, the AoE melee strike will provide a significant chunk of damage regardless and also the additional benefit of the instant explosion + KB. That's pretty much it... In general I'd say tracer is fairly weak early game and will need support (though she can work well enough to assist early ganks), while she has the potential to be extremely impactful late game, provided you are able to stay alive for more than 3 seconds (harder than it seems).",2,2,heroesofthestorm,TheTVTropesGuy,0

Slavery was abolished because it was IMMORAL and despite enforcing it, having whites enslaved under blacks would have made little sense. I find this similar to inequality in the legal system where some women argue that men are ""deserving"" of the injustices dealt to them by the system because of past injustices by men to women.

If you are an ostracized gay, a tranny, an obese person, a previously obese person, have tourette's, are extremely stupid, deaf or have a superiority complex ... well then, you will do well in UK Big Brother. This year, Dan should have won it hands down but out of those in the final, Sam was a clear winner. The other 4 were walking caricatures of what is wrong with this world.

You get killed by the role that is intended to do exactly that? Too bad, that role isn't total crap anymore! The whole purpose of a teamfight is to get and kill the enemy adc anyway, because if you don't then he's going to clean up everything and then kill your base incredibly fast. If you kill the adc and the midlaner, the whole rest of the team can maybe get one objective afterwards; if you kill everyone except the adc and mid they get two turrets and an inhibitor.

uid_170920,What's an oregon,2016-02,0,"Is the allure of Oregon fading? 3-5 years ago, Oregon was the ""hot shit"" team in the college football world. Their facilities, uniforms, and style of play were all unique and to an extent, new. They've had some coaching turnover, but tend to replace the departed with some high-level guys, and they've had some elite talent head to the NFL. They played for a national title twice(!) in the past 5 years. So why are their recruiting classes getting weaker? Based on 247's composite rankings, the last 6 classes for Oregon have been: 2011: 12th 2012: 13th 2013: 19th 2014: 21st 2015: 16th 2016: 27th Now, the 2015 class was admittedly pretty damn great, and I'm not saying any of these classes are bad - I would love to have any of them. But there's a clear trend, and it's not the kind you want to see. It seems like the allure of Oregon as a program has slightly dropped, and I'm wondering what has caused this. Was it the loss of Chip Kelly? Did we see a temporary spike because of the fancy facilities and Nike uniforms that everyone is finally over? Is it something else entirely? Am I overthinking this, or is Oregon's allure not what it was just 5 years ago?",-1,-1,CFB,Penguinkeith,1

But who is has the power to saying someone is not Gamergate or not? Gamergate are leaderless. If everyone is equal here, than why someone opinion is better than the next person. If someone say he is Gamergate, how you can you explain to other people that he is not part of Gamergate because they take part at activity that you not approve (to be clear, i also dont approve doxxing), because, once again, i think every other person opinion here is equal, because there is no rank here at Gamergate. If you said they are not part of Gamergate because majority of people said so, what if, hypothetically, the ""dox"" Gamergate is the majority, will they become the true Gamergate? Right now what im seeing is, Gamergate has its own different faction.

D&amp;D is balanced based on what is possible in a roughly medieval setting and any character coming from the future necessarily would come with ideas that don't fit in the D&amp;D world. That means your character knows stuff they wouldn't already know. For example technology has the possibility of really messing up the balance of the game. Does your character want to build a gun? Does your character know about printing presses? About electricity? About mechanization? All of this has to potential to make your character troublesome to deal with. Keeping the game immersive is more difficult if you have a character always thinking ahead or trying to overpower the bad guys with ideas that no other character has access to because the world hasn't gotten there yet. Also if you are from the future, are you going to start trying to mess with major events from the past that you are currently living in? In a game this means you might have extra information and that means extra work for the DM to figure out what you may know. Of course because the game depends on dice rolls this makes it extremely hard on the DM because they don't actually know what will happen. It's not a bad concept but it is troublesome, and it may present extra difficulties for your DM, which is why you definitely need DM approval.",3,-1,DnD,Noraf45,0

Even if I optimized that to $2 per 1000 visitors, it still would be just around $150/month for all my websites. But since I love doing these little, interesting projects, I will probably make more of them anyhow. Most of the projects I have in mind are little tools that cater my own curiosity.

Even now there is no knowledge of what actually causes testicular cancer. There are risk factors (of which i had none), sure, but no actual cause. I was an unlucky casualty of statistics. Thanks to my mother having fantastic healthcare, my family could easily afford the first half of my treatment. Unfortunately, halfway through my treatment, my mother's employer changed their provider. All the sudden, my oncologist and infusion clinic were out of network. At the time I was lucky enough to have one of the best testicular cancer oncologist in the south east and was a hospital in my home town. I would have had to find a new oncologist and a new infusion center (thanks to some very fierce fighting and LOTS of phone calls this was avoided). The time to do that might have rendered my treatment ineffective. The only person who was really qualified to handle testicular cancer cases where the first treatment option did not work was my current oncologist. Despite all this hassle, I survived. The point of that story is, it should not have had to happen. People talk about death panels rationed health care, well guess what, i lived it in our private system.

At dinner, I said something about Melania Trump's speech. I'm not looking to get into a political debate but I'm not a Trump fan and they're hard-core, deluding themselves Republicans. Anyway, after some ""debate"" (them yelling at me and telling me I don't know what I'm talking about) they ended with saying to themselves (but directed at me) ""of course she doesn't know what she's talking about, she's INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST."" And then finally to me, ""INTEGRITY IS IMPORTANT. (Implying that I have none)."" Now, first of all, that was really fucking mean. I ended up crying in the car for a minute just because I couldn't deal with being yelled at like that FOR MY REASONABLY JUSTIFIED POLITICAL BELIEFS.

That's what it's been all day and I'm really freaking out about it. IF they manage to remain civil today, unfortunately, I promised to spend time with my little brother tomorrow so I'll have to see them then too. Any ideas on what to do for tonight? Tips for discussing politics in a reasonable manner? Should I keep food in a plate in my hands at all times so I can stuff something in my mouth everytime they try to talk to me? HELP!

uid_585698,"All you have to do is meet her and ask, ""Are you willing to be second wife to a hot lesbian latino sister from my mission?""",2012-06,0,"guys, i need some advice short version: i'm 30, single, a returned missionary, and an atheist (which i've only just recently admitted to myself, though i've been inactive/less active for about 7 years now). my family is of the opinion (voiced with relative frequency) that i need to find a good wife and i'll settle down and everything will go back to the way things were when i first got home from my mission. my sister (the main ""offender"") is 24, married to the ward mission leader, two kids, has a master's in early childhood education, a primary teacher... basically the epitome of the perfect mormon wife. i know that what she does, she does out of love and genuine concern for my ""eternal soul"". after all, i can't make it to the celestial kingdom without an eternal companion. i know this because i used to believe the same thing. but this past week she did something that for some reason has really gotten under my skin: she set me up with a complete stranger (to her as well as me) for no other reason than the fact that we both live in the same city. basically, she met a girl who lives in my same city (and who she described as ""very attractive"") and gave her my phone number, telling her to give me a call. i don't know much about the exchange other than that. what i do know is that i got a call from this girl - who just finished her first year of law school at BYU and is working an internship with the DA here - offering me a ride to church. i've *never* been more uncomfortable on a phone call. luckily, i was out of town on sunday, so i was able to at least delay said fellowshipping effort, but i have a very difficult time saying ""no"" to people - especially people i don't know, so i agreed to ride with her next week (though i had forgotten that i'm going to be out of town again, so there'll be another awkward phone convo where i delay again). so here's my dilemma: i don't know what this girl's expectations are - i'm not opposed to going on a date with her, but i *really* don't want to be a reactivation project. i don't know exactly what my sister told her, either. my sister at this point knows i'm ""not that into the church"". she knows that i smoke - or at least her husband does, and i'd be seriously surprised if he'd kept that secret from her. my father knows i drink, and he found my condoms a while back while helping me clean my old car for sale. even if he hasn't shared these things with my sister, there are other signs. i rarely attend church when i'm visiting her or my parents. i didn't stand in the circle during her sons' baby blessings, and when my best friend since childhood got married last month, i waited outside the temple. i've never had a formal ""i don't believe"" talk with any of my family, but they know i'm not the wide-eyed RM i once was. i'm actually really upset about this. i don't like confrontation. i love my sister to death, and i don't want to do anything to alienate her from me. at the same time, i can't handle her attempts to save me - especially not if it involves pimping me out to random strangers. any advice (on either problem - how to talk to my sister, or how to approach interaction with this new girl) would be greatly appreciated.",1,1,exmormon,designerutah,1

He was giddy to prove he's no fool when it comes to technology, and I'm proud my little tricks have rubbed off on a user for once! I make my way to his office and survey the scene. Yup, power cord is tight in the back of the monitor, power button light doesn't turn on, button's not stuck or anything...

She was actually discharged from the hospital but still felt weak and nausea, and without support, checked back in to the hospital, but she is due to be released tomorrow again. The issue is she is in city A, but she found her research would be better done in another state entirely. This is a problem because her visa and grant are affiliated with the university there in city A. To finish her registration, she must show a lease agreement that lasts until she leaves. I absolutely do not want her staying with this family. They are uncaring, abusive to their dog, greedy, and dishonest. However, she has been told she MUST show an agreement for a place in city A. The way we see it her options are a) Pay the family and stay there (absolutely unacceptable in my view) b) Pay the family, but then leave c) Find another place to stay The bureaucracy has been torturing her. She already has been moving forward with an agreement with this family (it was rejected because it didn't last the entire time of her stay), and has much of the paperwork done. She literally has been spending a month just trying to get her registration done. The university head who is supposed to help her rarely shows up for work. When he does he treats her dismissively (white female alone in India), and is not fulfilling basic requirements to sign documents in a timely manner. So I am inclined to have her just pay the family, but leave anyhow. It will suck to eat the rent money, but staying with them is unacceptable. Quite frankly I think they need to be banned from having foreign guests, and wonder if some of what they do is usury or criminal. Furthermore she is still quite weak and cannot be going up and down stairs. I told her if she isn't going to stay in the hospital while she finishes this registration, then she should stay in a hotel so at least she can order room service and get some human decency. Is there another option we are not seeing? Are there any services that can handle this registration? My fiance insists she has to handle it herself, but I imagine there must be a way to get this taken care of with a little bit of money applied in the right spots, but I have no idea where to start or what to do. Please help, she feels trapped, is not getting proper care or rest as a result of this, and I cannot come to India for at least another week or so at least.",1,1,india,croodies,0

uid_854188,I agree he needs some time off as does Beltre who has played everyday since back.,2015-07,0,"Maybe Elvis would be better if he got a day off sometimes? Aside from catcher, shortstop is the most demanding position physically. But nobody in the major leagues has more plate appearances than Andrus since 2010. The only one who's close is Robinson Cano. The next SS who's on the list is Alcides Escobar who has about 400 fewer plate appearances than Elvis over the last six years. That's 67 fewer per season and I don't think that's insignificant. When it comes to innings played at shortstop, Elvis there are a few shortstops who have more over the same period of time: Alexi Ramirez (7708), Escobar (7468.2), Starlin Castro (7297). Andrus has 7292.2 while Ian Desmond has 60 or so fewer innings (7229.2). After that top five it drops way, way off. Additionally, while Elvis was young in 2010 and 2011, he made deep post season runs in those years which are not included here. He's the only SS who's done that twice. Escobar did it last season with the Royals. So maybe Andrus would be better if they didn't try to treat him like he's Cal Ripken? Maybe the kid is just tired and has had ailments build up oh him over the years? You know he does play half of those games in Texas. As most of us know the summer heat starts early and doesn't quit until October, but he's played in 861 of a total of 904 regular season games. Ramirez has a few more games but fewer plate appearances and plays in a relatively mild climate in Chicago. Oh and Elvis also leads the majors in pitches seen since 2010. The next shortstop on that leaderboard is Castro and he's seen 1773 fewer pitches than Andrus. If the Rangers want to get more out of Andrus, one thing they could try is picking up a utility infielder who can play short every four or five days.

uid_93823,"My god, your verbiage is infuriating.",2015-06,0,"Social Tradecraft, better known as the Thespian Society. From the beginning of my formal education, I was aware of the subtle differences between my cohorts and myself. In my youth, I was reserved, awkward, and profane. I was however extremely resourceful. At best, I floated through social interactions, never able to blend adequately without raising suspicions. As I grew up, I slowly learned social mirroring, and subversion. Up until my junior year of high school, I was treading water. My junior year I had my eyes set on a particular female classmate. Inexperienced, I struggled to close the deal. She was a senior, and heavily involved in the Theatre at our school. I played baseball so I did not normally associate with the *artsy* crowd too often. Long story short, I ~~traded~~ settled for a date, in exchange I had to audition in the school's next production. Over the next few years, I learned Social Tradecraft through exhaustive immersion. I define **Social Tradecraft** vary broadly, including both natural and contrived methods. Theatre was a cornucopia of information, and I partook with glutinous impulse. *Acting styles, verbal cadence, no verbal cues, costume design, lighting temperatures,* everything I needed to disguise myself like a social chameleon. Improvisation had the most profound influence on my social machinations. It is a pure symbiotic relationship with those on stage, and those in the crowd. Many believe instinct is what drives you, on the contrary, preparation guides your decisions, and motions. At first all the new information was cumbersome, but I was able to hone everything at the **Forensic Competitions**. The events hosted once a month at a local high school. A single event, with multiple categories that judges scored based on formalized rules. *Humorous Interpretation, Impromptu Speaking, After Dinner Speech, Duet, Solo Improvisation, etc.* Theatre offered a turnkey experience, with hands on instruction, and third-party evaluation. In the end, those tools allowed me adapt efficiently among those I had avoided for so long. I urge anyone here struggling with *Social Norm*, find a community theatre, or acting lessons. If you thought getting what you wanted was easy, you have no idea what you can truly achieve. Anyone have a similar epiphany in high school, or in general?",1,1,sociopath,Jooceyjooce,0

Firstly, it's not against PayPal's terms of service to sell bitcoins. You are totally allowed to do that. Secondly, let's talk about chargebacks. In PayPal, you can *either pay with your PayPal balance or a credit/debit card*. If you pay with your balance, PayPal has control over all funds and all disputes. You can also send as *friends and family or goods and services*. Friends and family payments **cannot** be reversed by PayPal when paying by balance, whereas goods and services payments **are disputable**. Let's say the customer disputes the payment (if made by G&amp;S). You now have to fight the case - sending bitcoin txids and chat logs to prove you send the bitcoins, etc. It's a hassle. However, if the customer does **not** pay by balance and pays with a card instead, then no matter whether he sends as F&amp;F or G&amp;S, he **can** chargeback the payment by contacting his issuing bank and having the payment reversed. If this happens, there's nothing you can do. So, if you want to do this: 1) Only deal with **reputed people** and **small amounts** 2) When dealing with non-reputed people, take payments from **balance only** and make sure they send as **friends and family**. It's not worth the hassle to fight a case if they chargeback. That's it. Hope this helped.",1,-1,Bitcoin,TroyPistachio,0

uid_822632,Because the richest man in BC has no power at all..,2015-03,0,"I am pretty secure on the NO side at this point. Compass Pass is officially only delayed, but it's obvious to anyone looking in that something went seriously wrong between purchase and implementation that cannot be fixed easily, or without spending a lot more money. No one has taken responsibility for the Compass failure, in fact last I heard it was being put to a third party to figure out. Jarvis was given a pay raise last year. Jarvis was complemented on his good job by mayors constantly up until about 1 week before his ""re-classification"" to advisor. Translink and the YES side keep bringing up contracts and the standard compensation package given to CEOs when a company wants to fire a CEO. The fact remains, if Jarvis was doing his job as they wanted, as the pay raises and complements suggest, they didn't need to fire him. It was a show of ""change"" that was likely planned by a small group in charge of translink and they didn't think the public would think much of the extra CEO cost. They were dead wrong. The Translink CEO is paid more than any transit org in North America. More than New Yorks gigantic MTA, more than LA, more than Toronto, even more than the East Japan Railway Company executives, which by comparison oversee more transit infrastructure than just about all Canadian transit put together. Why? Because the board (or whoever is making the decisions) felt the CEO deserved more. There has really been no oversight of the pay scale of Translink. Jim Pattison will have basically no power, from the way things are laid out now, over Translink. He will not be able to fire anyone, will not be able to change anything about the company. All he will do is chair another organization that will have the ability to look at all of the decisions, and money. The will likely just put out reports at the end of each year saying which decisions were good, bad, and how much money was wasted. I can't recommend a YES vote, but I understand the logic behind YES voters. They want better transit at any cost, regardless of how much we pay, how much waste, or how much stupidity is radiating from Translink. My main reason for wanting to vote no is more due to the regressive nature of the PST and how it will disproportionately harm the poor.",1,1,vancouver,captmakr,1

We've talked about it for awhile now and I've just now decided that I want to embark on this adventure with him. Now, I wouldn't say my parents are full on narcissists, but they definitely have their moments. Like today.. I went over there to hear their concerns and try to have them see my side of things. It turned into an hour of my dad telling me how I was making a mistake, that I should stay her where everything is comfortable and stable, and how I'm hurting them by making this decision. Okay, all valid reasons (I guess) but then he goes on to tell me that they've ""invested too much for me to throw it all away"". They're referring to the 12 years of Catholic school they spent on me to have a better education and to get ahead in life. I'm sorry, but I thought ensuring your child's education was part of being parent! Guess I was wrong there. Also, your daughter is an atheist and I'm no farther ahead in my career than any other kid who went to public school. Bit of a waste really if you think about it. They also think my boyfriend is brain-washing me to go with him.. Because I'm not capable of making my own decisions, obviously. Anyways, they said I can make whatever decision I want, but I should know that the right decision would be to stay...

uid_752082,"If you had just said you were from Latvia, you probably could have gotten away with it.",2015-01,0,"TIFU by enraging the parents of my girlfriend by pretending not to know what a potato is. Let me tell you that I have made a bad mistake this evening. My girlfriend (who let me tell you is only my 2nd girlfriend of all time) said I am ""invited to dinner"" with her and her parents. I was very aghast, nervous, and bashful to be invited to such a situation. But I knew it must be done. I met them nicely, I should tell you, and it started off in a good way. The idea slapped my mind that I should do a comic bit, to make a good impression and become known to them as a person who is amusing. When I saw that baked potatoes were served I got the idea that it would be very good if I pretended I did not know what potatoes was. That would be funny. Well let me tell you: backfired on my face. I'll tell you how. So first when the potato became on my plate, I acted very interesting. I showed an expression on my face so as to seem that I was confused, astounded but in a restrained way, curious, and interested. They did notice, and seemed confused, but did not remark. So I asked ""This looks very interesting. What is this?"" They stared at me and the mother said ""It's a baked potato."" And I was saying ""Oh, interesting, a baked....what is it again?"" And she was like ""A potato."" And I was like ""A 'potato', oh interesting. Never heard of a potato, looks pretty good."" And then they didn't see I was clowning, but thought I really did not know what is a potato. So I knew I would be very shamed, humiliated, depressed, and disgusted if I admitted to making a bad joke, so what I did was to act as if it was not a joke but I committed to the act of pretending I didn't know what a potato is. They asked me, VERY incredulous, did I really not know what a potato is? That I never heard of a potato. I went with it and told them, yes, I did not ever even hear of a potato. Not only had I never eaten a potato I had never heard the word potato. This went on for a bit and my girlfriend was acting very confused and embarrassed by my ""fucked up antics"", and then the more insistent I was about not knowing what a potato is was when them parents starting thinking I DID know what a potato was. Well let me tell you I had to commit 100% at this point. When I would not admit to knowing what a potato was, the father especially began to get annoyed. At one point he said something like ""Enough is enough. You're fucking with us. Admit it."" And I said ""Sir, before today I never heard of a potato. I still don't know what a potato is, other than some kind of food. I don't know what to tell you."" Well let me tell you he got very annoyed. I decided to take a bite of the potato, and when I did I made a high pitched noise and said ""Taste's very strange!"" That is when the father started yelling at me, and the mother kept saying ""What are you doing?"" and my girlfriend went to some other room. Finally the father said I should ""Get the fuck out of his house"" and I said it was irrational to treat me like this just because I never heard of a potato before. Well let me tell you he didn't take that kindly. Now in text messages I have been telling my girlfriend I really don't know what a potato is. The only way I can ever get out of this is for them to buy that I don't know what a potato is. I wish I never started it but I can't go back. I think she will break up with me anyway.",1,1,tifu,Karmakameleeon,0

It's a date, that's not to say either party is expecting to have sex or immediately start a long term relationship or something, but you asking a woman out for a private dinner implies that you're attracted to her. If she's not attracted to you, then wouldn't it be leading you on (and taking advantage of a free meal if you paid) to agree to a date? Looks matter a lot when you're considering someone to date. I think for a guy, having a good sense of humor and being confidence but not being cocky will get you far, but if a you aren't physically attracted to someone, it's unlikely you'd agree to a date.

So a good while back, PS3 had demons souls on sale for like 20bucks through digital download. No idea what the game was like, and didn't even know the two games were related for a long time, just bought it on a whim. After finishing demons, which took goddamn forever, I moved on to Darksouls and have just finished my first playthough. I haven't been this satistfied finishing a game series (soon to be trilogy!) in a long time. Thank you all for the help and tips I eventually needed, even though I tried my hardest not to ask for help. Reddit was a great place to talk to people because you all tried REALLY HARD not to give away spoilers and I appreciate it. The only thing I want to say about this game, is I wish I didn't have to cheat!! I feel like certain things like the covenants, some of the lore (i didnt realize pestering people repeatedly would get you more info), and certain interactions to get upgrades (would never ever ever EVER have found the pyromancer in blighttown without asking) I would have never gotten. I don't really mean this as a complaint because its one of the aspects of this game that makes it so mysterious and difficult, I was just a little disappointed I needed the crutch :) Anywho I ended up in most of Havels gear, Artorias' shield (Dat stability), Queelags firesword and felt like a complete badass fire-weilding knight by the end. What a great adventure.

If we don't make our dislike of these kinds of events known then as far as the devs are concerned we like them. The more we voice our displeasure with the way this event has been handled the more likely they are to change the next event that comes our way. Have you ever heard the expression ""the squeaky wheel gets the oil""? Your insistence that people hush up and wait for the events equates to saying ""I've seen a lot of apples fall off a tree in russia, but who knows if the apples in America also fall off trees?

He always talks about how his hack is undetectable and shit. Even after the VAC update and the ban wave, it's still not derected The problem is, I hate hackers, even if it's one of my friends, but he wont get banned soon I guess.

uid_324727,Yeah it was a real mistake back when they introduced a la carte radio pricing which is the thing that caused modern pop music to be repetitive.,2016-07,0,"What's flawed is your thinking that ""I'll only have 5 channels"". Bullshit. You're right back to circa pre-1980s TV where there are only a handful of channels in existence. You *will* pick more channels, and you're cable bill will end up being considerably higher than if everything was just bundled. How cheap can ala pricing *possibly* be per channel? These companies aren't going to do consumers any favors. They'll charge a per-channel cost that benefits them, not us. If an average cable bill is now $75/mo, all they have to do is charge $3 to 6 per channel with ala carte and most people would have *higher* bills, not lower. The average household is 3-4 people. If each person picks just 5 channels (which again, I find ridiculously low), and they are each priced at $3-6/channel then you're right back where you were before with monthly bills at least as high as before. And if you're OK with more niche channels falling by the way side, then don't complain when all sitcoms, all news shows, all reality TV shows start looking the same. That is exactly what will happen because shows will have to constantly aim at the lowest common denominator viewer. You like science shows? Well forget that. Everything will get dumbed-down for an audience that has a 6th grade level of science understanding. You like movies? Well only expect the most mainstream of movies to be shown. You'll turn TV into what radio has become... brainless repeating of the same 1/2 dozen ""hit"" songs.",4,4,cordcutters,prezuiwf,1

uid_947391,Wow yeah that sounds so strange...,2016-06,0,"As strange as it may sound, I look forward to the peaceful moments of NMS, as much as the exciting ones. I've been thinking about this for a while. I've been playing through a bunch of games recently, especially on the emulator side. Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 3, Midnight Club 3 Remix, Fairy Fencer F, Super Mario World, the new Doom demo, Doom I and II, Ridge Racer PSP... The thing about the vast majority of games, including the ones above, is that they're not designed to be peaceful. You go at the pace the designers set. And that's great. I love to have fun beating on people or racing cars or shooting every goddamn thing that moves, but sometimes I want a game where you can actually *stop* and just chill. Enter Minecraft, 5089 (an obscure procedural FPS made by a one-man dev), and eventually, No Man's Sky. These games are all procedural sandboxes, and they all offer something I desperately crave in games: peace. Downtime. Whatever you want to call it. This will sound strange, but some of my favorite moments in Minecraft are when I'm trekking around looking for new caves to spleunk, or relocating my home. There's no objective I must complete to progress, or enemies harassing me constantly. I'm free to follow my personal objective (""find the next cave"", ""move my house"", etc.). If I want to fuck around, I can. If I want to find challenging stuff and test my skills, I can. But I have the freedom to do whatever the fuck I want, in peace, without a mission marker or NPC's blaring at me. And the stuff I find is always changing. Each cave is subtly different and opens up a host of exciting situations--what will I find as I plunder deeper and deeper? I don't care if I'm always finding iron ore--each time I see that gray rock with golden dots, I get excited, same as when I happen upon some beautiful scenery. Most games believe that the player must be constantly stimulated. Platformers are filled with obstacles and enemies to overcome. FPS's have entire armies of enemies to shoot. RPG's have quests to complete, items to craft, and dungeons to plunder. But Minecraft and No Man's Sky instead parcel out the experiences. You have to find the exciting stuff, and there's actual *downtime*. No Man's Sky offers this with exponentially more variety and with a gorgeous art-style. I can go spelunking in a cave, tool through a forest aimlessly, or get into a space war and blow some shit up! Buy a new ship, upgrade my gun...and if I get tired of the same old planets then I can just warp out of there. Some say that NMS looks ""boring"".

I mean, question CLG management's savvy of setting up their new roster for failure next season, but damn, Double got a hell of a deal! Sure, having the reality of a major transition hit you is going to be emotional, but the TwitLonger post in the OP makes it clear that Double was given a lot of time and chances to shape up and he failed to do so. At some point, you run out of chances and it's time to face the consequences. Double can be butthurt that CLG didn't want to play his game, but CLG did the mature thing of making sure Double would be able to play his game the way he'd want to, and Double talks a pile of shit against them just to feed the Reddit drama machine? Yeah, no. Doublelift doesn't need my pity. He's still got a big future with TSM ahead of him, and in no small part he owes CLG's management for that. Where is his gratitude and humility? CLG could have totally left him in the cold like that announcement video portrayed, but they didn't, and Double threw them under the bus just to yank heartstrings and keep fans.

I was thinking about this the other day when I was replaying Conquest. When I promoted Corrin to Nohr Noble I got to thinking about how cool it would be if Corrin's character portrait actually changed outfits on promotion to their promoted class, and I imagined a scenario where you prove your worth to Garon so he bestows a title on you leading to your promotion. Similar to Ike, Micaiah, Sothe, and Volke in the Tellius games. Of course I would hope that they wouldn't be super late promotions like Roy's in Binding Blade. But I also got to thinking, what if certain characters had Paralogues that they unlocked at max level that they needed to complete to promote? These would be characters that are fleshed out enough to not be just an average unit, but not quite as important as the main lord and the most important cast members. It'd be a paralogue with a special objective and conditions relevant to the character. Similar to the Hidden Truths DLC where you can only use the units that the chapter gives you. Perhaps maybe only the characters that have A supports and up with the character who is the focus of the paralogue? As well as any characters who are canonically very good friends with the main one. I just felt that unit promotions felt a little too uneventful when they could be used as good story telling moments. All these units have aspirations that I thought could be tied to their promotion.

I initially thought that Dr Lyons was the only option, and after doing some reddit and facebook stalking I found out this was not the only option. I was told that a referral letter to the endocrinologist - Anthony Roberts - along with a psychologist (In this case, a Dr Georgina Cheng was recommended to me) assessment confirming the GPs diagnosis of 'Gender Dysphoria' was enough to get me a prescription of testosterone. What actually happened is that I called up the endo, got myself on his waiting list to be seen this November (2016) and got myself placed on his cancellation list, so that if anybody suddenly cancels their appointment, I will be asked if I would like their time slot. I booked my appointment with the endo about two weeks ago and I got a phone called yesterday telling me they had a cancellation. It took me two weeks to be seen by him rather than 8 months. The other thing to note is that at this time Dr Georgina Cheng the psychologist is away and won't be returning til mid June so I haven't had chance to get an assessment done by her yet. I had went to my endo appointment hoping that I could fax it through to him when I got it and then get my hormones prescribed by the end of June, but this isn't what happened. The endo invited me to his room, he was super professional, I'm not publicly out yet so my name is still my birth name and he didn't use my name, or any pronouns whilst talking to me. He's very informed and knows what he's talking about and I really appreciated that he could sense I was nervous and tried to lighten the mood with some jokes. He asked me if I was seeing a councillor or psychologist to talk about the Gender issues and I am. I'm confident I've got a decent support system surrounding my transition and I explained this. He prescribed me primolut to take for two months which just stops periods and he gave me a script for primoteston 250 (with three repeats) to take after my first two months of primolut. *Quick note here! - I have been on Dr Lyons wait list to be seen in October, just in case I got backtracked and was told I HAD to see him. I let the endo know this and he said if I intended to go and see Dr Lyons he could not prescribe me hormones as it would cause complications for him. If I cancelled my appointment with Dr Lyons and had another decent mental health supportive system he was happy to let me bypass him completely due to Lyons' wait list now being two years long.* I then made a second appointment to see the endo in 5 months time to check my hormone levels, at which time I'll be 3 months on testosterone.

I remember being so excited about this series, about this story. It consumed me for years. I was just a naive summer child then, all those years ago when I only had to wait 6 months after discovering A Game of Thrones with that Robert Jordan blurb on the cover. Just six months for the third book in the series to be released. So long ago. Ages ago. In that time I entered and graduated college. I met a woman, fell in love, got married, and had kids. I watched in disbelieving fascination as HBO first picked up the rights, then greenlit the pilot, then pushed the story to series. I have spent almost half of my life waiting for the next installment and then the next installment and then the next installment. I have been introduced to and completed whole other fantasy series in that time. I even watched the Wheel of Time series - one I never thought would ever end - end. All while waiting for the next A Song of Ice and Fire book. I'm so sick and tired of waiting. My passion for this series, which was once red hot, is not smoldering and dying out. I have become so jaded that I truly believe we will see the end of the series on HBO before we will probably get even the next book and when that book is eventually released it will come with the news that Martin will need to write two or three more books which, frankly, I don't see as possible. A book series that I cherished more than most of my siblings, a book series that helped shaped the man I am today, a book series that had more influence on my life than 95% of my teachers and professors, and these days I feel little but disappointment from it. This is what parents must feel like when their children grow up to become criminals or high school dropouts or just total ineffective losers. And I fucking hate it.",42,42,asoiaf,Phaelin,0

uid_664616,Don't forget Bed Sheets,2014-12,0,"Forgive my non-die hard opinion in the following reply on Lucas and his franchising methods and scale but I think that is a good question and shouldn't be downvoted. Everyone in media (film &amp; TV) knew there was a blank check on their desk but they didn't realize how much money was in the bank account. Lucas picked up a pen and wrote a huge number with Star Wars, then he deposited the check and it cleared. It's still clearing. He just found another check from Disney, wrote a huge number on it - and it cleared too. It's hard to compare because The Avengers uses preexisting marketing techniques which were really pioneered and amplified by Lucas. It also uses preexisting characters, characters which have existed for decades already based on a ""universe"" that has been around since the middle of the last century. So the universe is already ingrained and has a ton of money behind it. The Avengers is like 50th generation after Star Wars. There have been quite a few franchises that have come and gone since SW (Robocop even had toys, probably because of Star Wars). Franchising and cross-marketing at this scale just wasn't a thing back then. Before Star Wars it wasn't really a ""thing"" to have an indy film come out of nowhere AND THEN be exploited through all the marketing integration (toys, happy meals, pj's, shoes, keychains, cartoons, radio shows(!), board games, novels, comics, countless other crap with the star wars logo on it. Also remember there wasn't TMNT, Transformers, Pokemon, Mario Brothers, Minecraft or Halo back then. It wasn't really a thing to have Pokemon branded cups at Taco Bell. You could get spiderman PJs and a shitty mask, you could get GI Joes and so on, but it wasn't as infused with other consumable industries. So then everything ""Star Wars"" was for sale including the story and character development - Hello ewoks. A big part of it were the toys, the cartoon specials, mixed in with the serious story telling and somewhat serious setting. It wasn't necessarily for kids originally (although the archetype of the Heroes Journey is as old as human story telling), but it was a huge hit with kids and families, and thats a huge market, you can make a lot of money if you get them hooked (Pokemon/TMNT/Transformers anyone?). Star wars toys were the original pokemon. ""Gotta collect em all!"". Although Barbie and GI Joe exploited this as well, it just wasn't to the same scale. It's like Lucas invented the electric guitar when everyone else was using acoustic guitars. Yes Lucas always loved kids in the sense that he loved movies from his youth and wanted to recreate the serial film magic from the golden days, but I don't think his original intention was to make a kids movie. That said he was really dynamic and wise to ride that wave and turn it into a franchise. Not all ""artists"" (film makers in this case) are willing to do that with their craft. If you look at the few movies Lucas made before SW you'll see they're somewhat serious and didn't really have ""legs"" for toys or an extended universe. I would say, look at it in reverse. The Avengers wouldn't have all these tie-ins promoting it at this level if Star Wars hadn't done it. Same with Minecraft, and so on.",1,1,StarWars,Nietzsche_Peachy,0

Often the range you'll get feedback from is in the highs so you can fix that by pulling a mic's high range down a bit. The only hard and fast rule I can give you is to always be listening.

With the recent ACL injury to Dante Fowler JR and Jeff Fisher's comments that the Rams go to great lengths during the rookie mini camp to avoid injury, I started to think about the conundrum that is the off season knee ligament injury, if they are avoidable, freak accidents or caused by improper training. First, being a Jaguars' fan, there is history between Fisher and the team I love, but to be completely honest, his approach to the rookie mini camp seems like a good idea and I believe he was just being honest at his approach. Heck, I kind of wish Gus Bradley did the same. Dante is known for practicing with intensity, and I'm wondering if this could have been avoided if they just did a walk through. But was Fowler's knee ready to explode at any time? Couldn't it just happen during OTAs or training camp? There's no possible way to avoid it from happening, right? Yoga is for girls. Pilates is for vegans. Lynn Swann was obviously joking when he said he practiced ballet, right? It just seems to me with the huge investment of a first round pick, NFL teams would go to tremendous lengths to avoid something like this. Case studies, Sports science-type labs with wires hooked up to player's knees. Is any of this coachable? Do coaches that are known to go hard during training have a lower or higher injury rate? I want to know if coaches actually coach on how to avoid blowing your knee out when during simple non-contact drills. I want to know if NFL teams invest time and effort on the science of ligament prevention (if it even exists). I want to know if this is actually avoidable during the off season, then why the hell does it keep happening?",0,0,nfl,makeplayz,1

Some douchebag from the hockey team liked to pick on him and tried to fuck with his backpack and shit at lunch. The problem was that this oddball geeky kid had hands down the best wrestling pedigree of anyone on the entire team.
