uid_908007,hard work pays off when you're mad?,2014-11,0,"This reminds me of a parable my tai chi instructor told me: Long ago in ancient China, a rich nobleman's son wanted to learn Shaolin kung fu. With great pomp and ceremony, he left his home and went to the temple. He met with the head monk, who agreed to let him study kung fu at the temple. The rich man shaved his head and donned the robes and was led to a room containing a well and a barrel of water. The monk told him to slap the surface of the water with his palm until no water remained in the barrel. The rich man didn't understand, but did as he was told. He slapped the water with his palm and a little water splashed onto the floor. He repeated the slapping for what seemed like hours until no water remained. He found the monk and told him he had finished. The monk instructed him to fill the barrel again and repeat the task. This scene repeated for days. Eventually, the rich son stopped going to the monk and just refilled the barrel without being told. He grew angry. He suspected he was the butt of a cruel joke, and that the monks would never teach him kung fu but he knew that if he returned to his family having only slapped water he would be a laughingstock. Eventually, the seasons changed and the rich son returned home for the holiday feast. His family was so proud of him for studying kung fu, even though he was secretly ashamed that he had not received even one day's instruction. ""What kung fu did you learn? What did they teach you?"" his family asked, eagerly. ""They didn't teach me anything,"" he mumbled. ""Oh, you are so modest, tell us what they taught you!"" they urged. The man grew enraged.

uid_83541,"Yes, much less safe to have the license plate, times/route, and picture of every driver you have on Uber than to have a random taxi driver...especially while drunk!",2016-07,0,"This is one of the things that worries me most about companies like Uber. The background checks are a joke and the company definitely puts profit before customer safety in my opinion. I live in Burlington, VT and the city had to come to a strict agreement with Uber not to hire people with DUI's or sex offenses after an Uber driver was accused of sexual assault on a drunk passenger. It's ridiculous that the city would have to force Uber to make that an official policy, but then I came to find out that there is essentially no oversight of taxi companies here at all. They've been caught having drivers with DUI's, sex offenses, licenses suspended and a myriad of things you would assume would get you fired immediately. And if they are fired, what do they do? Move on to the next cab company. The judicial process takes far too long to remove specific drivers or revoke a companies license. I assume it's the same in many cities and legislators should update whatever laws to create some kind of checks and balances. It's common sense. Personally, I've had several cabbies make weird, sexual comments to females I was riding with. Most people are non-confrontational, so they'll try to politely deflect a creepy comment to avoid an awkward situation. I'll just tell them to their face they're being weird and inappropriate and it's always met with bewilderment, like they're just making small talk. They'll shut up eventually, but I can't imagine what it would be like as a female, alone in that situation. Especially at night when most passengers are leaving the bars, probably drunk. It's definitely a problem that needs to be dealt with in this city, but based on the way politics move here I doubt they'll do anything until someone actually gets assaulted or killed.",3,3,TwoXChromosomes,SomeStupidFucker

uid_560926,Women are naturally more spiritual than men so they were never going to make it anyway!,2015-11,0,"Plural marriage doesn't work. Not now. Not in the next life. I was watching the documentary ""Prophets Prey"" which describes life in the polygamist communities of Texas and Short Creek that are under the control of the FLDS Church in Warren Jeffs. One sociological flaw that I never seriously considered, but seems so obvious, is the ratio of men to women. In order for FLDS leaders to take multiple wives, a good chunk of the men have to be kicked out of the community (since a small select group of men are hoarding all the women). Let's suppose for a minute that Joseph Smith truly was a prophet and inspired by God to reveal the celestial order of marriage, which is plural marriage. If that were true, then the **majority of men will have no place** in the celestial kingdom and will not even be permitted to have a female companion for all eternity, as they will be hoarded by a select group of men. The ratios are much more dire then you'd expect, but again are really quite obvious mathematically. Let's say the average man has five wives. That would mean **80% of all men would have no place in heaven**. That's worse than the 1/3 that were supposedly kicked out before earth life. Yes the ratios are closer to what Joseph Smith and Brigham Young followed, only one in 48 men have a shot a heaven. That means 98 percent have their wife taken away (like property) and reassigned to a man who only sleeps with her once every six weeks. If life in America has taught you anything, it's not your odds of ending up in the 1% are pretty low. Like a 1 and 100 shot. So the odds are pretty good that your wife is going to be taken away and reassigned to some dirtbag apostle or something.

Is it a HUGE can of worms to open, if you click no? There is a box that opens if you click no, so I could explain, but here's my issue- I do not totally think my transcripts reflect my academic ability (does anyone?), as in one university I have attended (in Norway) the grades are comprised of only the exam results (the papers, presentations etc. are not counted in the final grade). At the other uni I've been at (in the UK) the grade is 2/3 exam, and the other third split between a single paper and a short mid-semester test. I am not a good test-taker, and the grades for all of my key areas are B's (a few As and one C in others), although each of my key area essays (except one) has gotten an A. I'm applying to universities in the US and Canada, and I'm not betting the admissions committees in my department will bother to read the whole ""description of education"" pages of my transcripts, and I'm not even sure they explain the actual ways the grade is composed. Would it be acceptable to explain all of that? I'm worried that, if I said all of my papers got A's when there is no documentation of this, and my references don't know this as the marking is anonymous, it would seem like I'm lying.

Europe is not North America. North America has only a few countries to deal with and amazing transparency between borders and amalgamation of systems. Our systems are designed to work together and talk to each other, seamlessly. Europe is not that way, even today the geopolitical realities means there's a lot of mismatch between countries that are all over the place relative to each other. Not to mention the sheer number of countries and regulations and systems. A tiny problem in one can bring the whole damn system down. People want simple answers, maybe Riot doesn't have one, maybe the answer is so insanely technical that sharing it would be meaningless to anyone who's not a network engineer. Maybe they don't even know the problem. The problem may not be in their control, and they may not even have the ABILITY to discover the problem. However telling the fanbase ""we don't know what the problem is and probably never will"" is not an answer that will make anyone happy, so they say ""we're working on it"" and do what they can. Riot is not ""out to get Europe"". That is utterly nonsensical. What would they stand to gain from giving most of a continent sub-par service? If they knew what the problem was and could fix it, they would have already done so. The fact that they have not should be evidence enough of this. As for why you cannot discuss it in forums and on the subreddit, it's because it does nothing to further the discussion. None of you know the problem either, so it's not like balancing discussions where valid ideas can emerge from the community. No one is going to write a post that makes Riots engineers go ""OF COURSE! That's it!"". Instead each of these threads descend into circle-jerks of complaining and conspiracies about Riot's hatred of Europe. There's nothing TO discuss, what you want is to vent. Venting is not actually useful, catharsis has been disproved as a psychological theory a long time ago. All it is is toxicity and negativity, so it's not useful to the community. Everyone knows the EUW servers are troubled, this is not news to anyone. And that's why the problem hasn't been fixed and why you can't talk about it. The problem is (currently) not fixable, and talking about it won't help anything and will do more damage than good. It sucks and I feel for you all, but there's really nothing to be done and that's just life sometimes.",2,2,leagueoflegends,Tdfn

Are you saying that you have previously witnessed the rise and fall of climate across the globe? No ofcourse not that'd be silly. You are saying that how you know this information is from *scientists* studying the history of our planet. Convenient that when *scientists* say this has happened before using evidence such as core sample, using theories and simulations, they conclude this is a continuing cycle. But when *scientists* say that humans have increased the rate of change (acceleration) of the climate change, it is unfounded and holds no weight. The problem is not whether or not climate change has existed in our past. By all accounts it looks like a cycle that took place over hundreds of thousands of years. The problem is that the cycle has been accelerated by humans to occur unnaturally. History of our planet has never seen this type of acceleration before, and what is difficult is trying to determine what effects this will have on the planet. For example, if climate change use to take 500,000 years to go from -20C to 20C, that gave animals 500,000 years to adapt, move locations, evolve to the difference in temperature. Now let's say that humans' impact on the planet will cause the same change (-20C to 20C) in only 50,000 years. Species which are use to adapting over 500,000 years now only have 50,000 to adapt.

Based on the new trailer something really leaped out at me. Kylo Ren says he will ""finish what [Vader] started"". Depending on what context this is used, it could redefine some expectations about Ren's character. The assumption is that Ren is trying to be a Vader copycat and fulfill Vader's mission of conquering the galaxy and being an evil overlord. What if Ren is actually speaking in regards to Anakin Skywalker's goals. (Ending the Clone Wars/Civil War and bringing peace to a unified Galactic Republic). Ren is supposed to be the ultimate Vader fanboy, it wouldn't be too far fetched to claim he has knowledge about Vader's life as Anakin. Growing up in a war-torn Galaxy after two Civil Wars and chaos after the overthrow of the Empire would almost certainly provide a motivation to create peace, through whatever means. Ren seems to be taking steps to found a new Empire (and maybe a new jedi council under the ""Knights of Ren"" moniker). Ultimately, peace and stability, for Padme's sake, were Anakin's goals Maybe by finishing what was started, Ren means ending the Civil War, bringing peace to the Galaxy, uniting the Republic, and re-establishing the Jedi Order without the archaic and hypocritical practices of Anakin's time.

More specifically, a separate queue from more team-based objectives (though in all objectivity deathmatch would end up being best played with team strategies in mind). It would draw those players who only ever played mccree or reaper away from team based games where they screw their team by playing for potg rather than for the win, while giving *them* a much better experience. We spend our time complaining about how annoying those solo players are, and I totally take part in this circle-jerk, but in all fairness the experience can't be thrilling for these people either. Regardless of your moral opinion on players who play like this, it's fair to recognize that they are free to play a game they bought and have as much right as we do to get a good experience from it. If the solution can be a win-win that benefits both types of players, why isn't there a separate queue for gamemodes that are more appropriate for people who'd rather fight for personal glory? Hell, it could even have a potg for each team to increase further the satisfaction from the target audience. I know I would occasionally play it and it would certain drain some ""bad"" team players away from the modes we're used to. So: has there been talk about this? Everything I hear from development points towards keeping the current structure but has deahmatch (or similar modes) even been considered? Look at TF2: the reason it's less annoying to lose objective maps because of your team's solo spirit is because there are many modes in which that's perfectly okay, and players who like that naturally gravitate to it and leave the objective maps to people who truly care about objectives. tl;dr: make deathmatch mode, will please everyone and keep incompatible players out of each others' way, regardless of what player archetype you think is bette",1,1,Overwatch,bobjoethud

UBI does not mean that there are more people or more houses. We already have a **massive** housing surplus... and yet prices have gone way up. And that's without any UBI at all. In other words, your assumption is too simplistic and is at odds with the empirical data about recent housing market behavior. Housing has been trending toward ""upscale"" properties for a long time even in the face of famously stagnant wages. You could just as easily say that low-end housing prices will either decrease or find a soft-cap since the lower end of the economy would be depending upon (read: *limited to*) their UBI... a landlord can put a sticker on his shithole, rat-infested apartment that says ""$100,000/yr"", but that doesn't mean he's going to get a tenant. It's far more likely that he's just waving around the price tag for the sake of marketing and fully intends to leave that unit empty while he decides what to do with it or until he can find someone who wants to buy that plot to demolish it to build a strip mall. Ultimately, the housing market must obey the supply and demand of its consumer base. Low end rents won't rise any higher than the lower end can afford (in which case... if they can afford it, what's the problem again?), and the upper middle segments will begin breaking even with the UBI in their taxes, so their housing won't increase either (because their net income won't change). And the upper end doesn't matter because their markets are not influenced by what millionaires *can afford*, they're governed by what millionaires *want to have*.

(Palpatine) -Creating a dictatorship. (Palpatine) -Order 66 and the murder of countless jedi. (Palpatine) -Force choking and murdering employees for events that are at times out of their control. (Vader) -Attempting to kill a defenseless luke after he surrenders his weapon. (Palpatine) -Seizing control of cloud city despite their attempts to cooperate. (Vader) -Testing out a carbon freeze system on an unintended individual just to make sure it won't kill the intended one. (Vader) -Beginning a war against the Republic that will claim countless lives. (Palpatine, Dooku) -Scheming and indirectly attempting to murder a senator. (Dooku) -Influencing the creation of a Droid and clone army with the intention of the two to fight each other. (Palpatine) -Soliciting the services of bounty hunters to either assassinate or capture persons of interest. (Dooku, Vader) -Creating not one, but two super weapons capable of mass genocide in a mere moments time. (Palpatine) -Murdering an old friend while he was defending himself and after he turns his weapon off. (Vader) -Attempting to murder a family member, specifically a son, after he doesn't join the dark side. (Vader) -Killing a sith master on a impulsive decision after years of servitude. (Vader) -Murdering a sith master while he sleeps and is defenseless. (Palpatine) -Murdering a disarmed and defenseless sith apprentice.

uid_260173,G2-- TSM's farm team,2016-03,0,"Thank you LoL community &amp; congratulations G2.LoL! It has become apparent to me that some people's opinion of old ocelote may overshadow their opinion of G2 Esports and the success of our current League of Legends team during our first ever split in the EU LCS. I'm writing to thank those of you who have stuck by us through thick and thin and to welcome the new fans we've wooed over the course of this split. We realize we are the new kids on the block, but as you can see, by grinding wins over the past 9 weeks we have truly earned our spot in the LCS for what will hopefully be many seasons to come. In G2 everyone is family, and our League of Legends players and coach have worked extremely hard since the beginning of this year to prove all the naysayers wrong and contest for a top 3 spot in the first split. Here we are at the end of the regular split and our team have earned 1st place with a 15-3 record, ahead of a very strong field of teams. On behalf of the entire G2 fam, I hope you will ignore the ocelote of past, and instead join me in congratulating our players Perkz, Hybrid, Kikis, Trick, Emperor &amp; coach Youngbuck on a regular split that far exceeded everyone's expectations (including my own, not gonna lie) and continue to show your support as we fight for glory in Rotterdam in just a few weeks. I plan on being there to support our players in person, and hope to see a huge turnout from all of you, to support your favorite teams and players. As you know, qualifying for LCS was long and hard fought, but we did it and continued to fight on. I am extremely happy we (G2) are still supporting League of Legends and the community that has offered me so much and I guarantee you that we will continue to do so for many years to come. Thank you. Best, ocelote PS: I originally posted this message straight after our victory on Friday night, but it was taken down due to the spoiler regulations - Sorry!",1,1,leagueoflegends,vsn611

When I go to a game, i want a Dodger dog. When I go to a game, I don't want to have to smuggle things in. I need a new hat and I am buying a Seager jersey very soon. I want Dodger games back on TV as much as the next guy, but I'm definitely not willing to do *any* of this. Especially since I already get to watch the games anyways. The problem with this plan is that, again, most of us have *some* way of watching games, legally or otherwise. Just submit to TWC, either switch over or do what I do, but accept that you aren't going to change anything. TWC and the Dodgers are billion dollar industries, a few hundred or even thousand people not buying hot dogs isn't going to even make a fucking *dent* in their profit margins. It sucks and it's unfair but, hey, life isn't fair, you accept things and you move on. Buy an apple TV, get unlocator or hola or whatever VPN you want, set it up, and enjoy Vin's last season.

Based on how I think the current mechanism works, I dunno if they'd be able to do this without redesigning it, but it would be cool if there was a setting that shortened the trigger travel further, so they were real hair triggers.

They made it a lot more accessible for more people and I wanted to see how I could fare in it, specifically with Jigglypuff. To my dismay she's not a very good character but I still will try to be the best Puff in that game too. PM was actually a really good buffer for Melee and Brawl, but for Smash 4 and Melee we don't quite have something like that. The best thing I can say is play both games and attend tournaments for both games. It's actually a really exciting time for Smash because both communities are actually coexisting in a really wonderful way. I feel like the Melee community has Smash 4's back and vice versa. So it's awesome to feel like I am part of both now. Go to tournaments for both games! For 64! PM! Melee! Brawl! Smash 4! All smash games.

My gf has slept in the same bed as other people, a few different times since we met. We've talked about it and I told her it makes me uncomfortable, but she continues to do it. She swears up and down that she has been faithful. She is Bi and has had gf's in the past, which I'm totally cool with, but she has slept with girls and guys since we started dating. Also she is co-dependent and hates to be alone, or stay alone. She just left me for a month to go back where we're from. Before she left, we discussed our boundaries in the relationship. She and I agreed that even cuddling and kissing other people are out of the question, since we are both faithful. So two nights after she got there, she had a lesbian couple over (mutual friends of ours) they had drinks till 4 am and all slept in her bed. Now she is going to a 3 day festival with the same girls. She tells me on the phone yesterday the girls are bringing their guy friend, and you guessed it, he and my gf are sharing a tent. Again she swears she has always been faithful and I have nothing to worry about, but she also knows it upsets me when we talked about it. I've asked her if I did the same thing, how it would make her feel, and she did not like the idea of me doing it. Which kind of pisses me off. Cake and eat it too? All in all, I do care about her a ton and want to stay with her if possible. I've believed most of what she tells me in our 2yrs together, however at times I want to leave the relationship, because of this stuff. I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar experience with someone they love? Also is this normal behavior for some people and should I just let it go? --- **tl;dr**: Gf of 2yrs. has ""slept"" with other people since we've been together and swears she has been faithful.

Furthermore, teaching involves professional development, developing and acquiring new requirments that come forth due to the evolving environment of education is a core part of being a teacher.

But, while I never once received a Breath of Heaven, and he only ever dpalmed himself, his healing numbers were impressive. And then, I realized about my own Kharazim play: I'm always proud of my numbers. But, like Nazeebo, Kharazim constantly puts out numbers. You can tank a minion wave by yourself and get 1k healing. Do a camp, get 1k healing. But like Nazeebo, a lot of the time, those numbers are too gradual to help, and not at crucial times.

This Reddit is probably filled with stories like this but I could not not post the guys idiodicy. So I hopped onto PS3 ghosts because infected is bae and I found a game 15 hours later. Now in this game was a user who goes by ""blakepurtle"". I played 5 matches without anything happening then I managed to get the last 2 kills on octane as an infected, this is when this guy started thinking I was a hacker. I'm a pretty bad player when it comes to cod so at first I took this as a compliment but then he became more annoying and idiotic. For one he would've seen if I had a mod menu because I had killed the last guy I had no mic to explain. I messaged him asking if he honestly thought I hacked and he said in his mic ""Yeh you fucking dick cunt."" At this point I'm laughing my ass off. Then the guy got an infected to block him in an area but I managed to ricochet a knife and kill him. This is when it got funnier. Next game starts and I die pretty early, I manage to kill him and then he says ""You fucking hacker cunt I'm gonna report you you dog."" I was too bored to explain that ghosts reporting is dead and I went on. He also said ""even though you hack I still survived longer"". Next game I go on a 12 streak as a survivor but then purtle killed me. He then says ""Yeh you fucking suck mate, I manage to kill you even though you hack faggot."" Next game he was first infected, he managed to kill 2 guys and then he said ""OI hacker, that's more kills you can get with no hacks on. I then by pure luck, get a kem (Basically a nuke if you haven't played ghosts). And then he says *Turn god mode off you hacking dick*.

uid_926448,we're uh pretty fucked from what i've been going through and what other people say lets just hang on for the best,2015-11,0,"Please tell me Junior year gets better (Warning: long rant ^sorrynotsorry) Hey guys, so I'm a Junior this year (the notoriously worst year of high school) and so far it's staying true to it's reputation. I've always had trouble adjusting back to school at the beginning of the year, and within the first few weeks it usually gets easier to adjust to, but it hasn't - it just keeps getting worse. The end of the marking period is this week, so all of my teachers have assigned tests/projects/assignments due by Friday so that they can cram in any last-minute grades. This means I have at least 2 tests every day this week, along with a project or assignment due each day as well. My English teachers gave my class a two day notice on a massive test, and we hadn't even finished a portion of the section until today. My school's policy is that teachers need to give you at least a week's notice for tests, so that you have plenty of time to study for it. He didn't, and is claiming that it's our faults for not knowing about it (when it was never mentioned/up on the school website). He just gave us a test yesterday, and then barely announced at the end of the class that there would be another test this Friday, but then changed it to tomorrow instead without telling us (we don't have his class on Friday so he had to bump it back a day - but didn't bother to tell us about it). If my classes weren't stressful enough, then there's my school's Fall Drama stressing me out, because the director of it contacted me asking if I could design and organize her the **entire** playbill within two weeks, with no assistance whatsoever. She gave me only a small portion of what I need for it, and has no idea what to do for the rest of it and she just assumes I know what I'm doing with it. She is very particular about how she wants the ads section arranged, but half of the ads that were sent in aren't files I can open on my laptop, and I have no idea where to even begin with all of the shit that needs to be done with it. Looking back on some of the playbills from previous shows, it definitely looks like she hired someone to make them, and that this year she just dragged some unsuspecting 16 year old girl who she heard was ""a whiz with Microsoft Publisher"" (spoiler: I haven't touched Publisher since my freshman year) to do the dirty work for her so that she didn't have to pay someone for it.

uid_544444,LOL,2016-02,0,"I first tried psychedelics at 20, always had a great time. I would trip a few times a year on shrooms or acid, enjoyed both. At 26 I was having a go away party as I was moving back home after a few years in a different state. I picked up some good shrooms for all of us, and it looked to be a good time. About 20 minutes before I was set to head over, the kid in the apartment above me flooded his bathroom, causing gallons to pour through my ceiling, stressing me out. I thought about passing on the trip, but it was my last time I could do this with my friends down there, so I sucked it up. After we popped them, I had an amazing come up, which excited me as the last batch had been complete duds. We had an amazing time going around my buddies apartment complex, I'll never forget the light reflecting off their pond, or playing on the playground equipment, having it morph as I ran through it. We got back to his apartment, and for the first time ever, I was ready for my trip to be over before it was done. I started getting extremely uncomfortable. Time started looping, I swear I had the same trip to the bathroom 3 times. The last coherent memory I have is lying on a sleeping bag on the floor, thinking I had peed myself while my friends watched (which actually never happened). I woke up 3 days later in a hospital bed, with my family next to me. This scared me, as they all lived 3 states away. My chest hurt, and I had a scar on my left breast. I then noticed I couldn't move my legs. I thought I was tied up in blankets, so I reached down to pull them off. That's when I noticed I couldn't feel my hand on my leg. Apparently, deciding I wanted the trip over, I sent myself over the balcony of my friend's porch balcony, to end the trip like a dream to wake up. The problem was it wasn't a dream, and his porch was on the 3rd story. I broke a rib that punctured my left lung, which is what gave me the chest pain. I landed on my back, fracturing vertebrae from T6 down. When I woke, they had already opened my back from shoulder to butt, and stabilized it with rods. About a year and half later, my paralysis starts at the belly button, with some control till my knees, then nothing below that. I count myself lucky, I could be dead or unable to even type this. Please, if you decide to take a psychedelic, even if you're experienced, be safe. Make sure nothing is off with your set or setting, and that a sober friend is always present.

Trump was very popular among Chinese-Americans, he also got more votes from blacks and Hispanics than Mitt Romney. I doubt those people were all racist, homophobic, neo-nazis or anti-semites. Trump never said or suggested anything about doing anything negative to the blacks, (legal) Hispanics, gays, trans or Jews. Yet, people think suddenly he's going to oppress all those groups. He's actually said the opposite, during his campaigning he said he was going help the LGBTQ and black communities. But the ""leftist"" from those communities are under the impression he's going to use the power he doesn't have (and won't have) to suddenly oppress them when he officially goes into office.

uid_830861,joke's on you: he's not joking,2016-04,0,"Motorcycle safely act (California only) Motorcycle Safety and Child Protection Act The Motorcycle Safely Foundation is pleased to announce that Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) has agreed to be the principal author of the Motorcycle Safety and Child Protection Act of 2016. The bill will be introduced during the first week of April and will contain MSF's full 10-point plan for improving motorcycle safety: 1. Limiting riding to daylight hours on all roadways constructed or maintained with the use of any federal funds (which covers virtually all roadways other than those in private subdivisions). 2. Imposing a nationwide 55 mph speed limit on all two-wheeled vehicles using public roadways. 3. A prohibition on riding in the rain or on wet roads. 4. Mandatory full face, DOT-approved helmet use for all riders and passengers. 5. A prohibition on passengers of less than 18 years age. 6. A horsepower to weight ratio limit for all new motorcycles of 0.10 (e.g., limiting the horsepower of a 600 pound motorcycle to 60). 7. Governors on all new motorcycles limiting the top speed to 75 mph (the highest speed currently allowed by any state). 8. Revising the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards to require anti-lock braking systems (ABS), lawn mower style (i.e., ""deadman"") throttle controls, and tipover protection devices on all new motorcycles beginning in 2018. 9. Applying passenger car emission standards to all new motorcycles by 2018, including a requirement of 10% of each manufacturers production to be Zero-Emission Vehicles, powered by either batteries or hydrogen fuel cells. 10. Controlling carbon dioxide emissions from motorcycles by requiring Corporate Average Fuel Economy of 82.5 miles per gallon by 2018. MSF's 10-Point Plan for Motorcycle Safety will dramatically reduce death and injury caused by motorcycling through a coordinated series of cost-effective, technological solutions. 1. Don't Fight the Night. Riding a motorcycle in daylight is risky business. Riding a motorcycle at night is foolhardy. Wildlife is more active and harder to see. Irregularities or debris on the road surface are harder to see. The motorcycle itself is harder to see. 2. Stay Alive at 55. Responsible states, such as California, recognize that some vehicles are inherently more dangerous than others. That's why heavy trucks are limited to speeds of 55 mph in California. U.S. Department of Transportation statistics prove that motorcycles are far more dangerous than any other type of vehicle used on public roadways. There is no reason why motorcycles should be allowed to travel at higher speeds than trucks. MSF estimates that a nationwide speed limit of 55 mph for motorcycles will reduce the annual death toll by 26.7%. 3. Slippery When Wet. The inherent instability of single-track vehicles results in enormously increased accident risk under conditions that reduce traction. It's possible to quickly recover from a minor slide in a 4-wheeled vehicle, but as soon as a motorcycle starts to slide, it falls. Combined with the lack of windshield wipers and closed passenger compartments, motorcycles are inherently unsafe in wet weather and should be parked. 4. Protect Your Head or End Up Dead. Head injuries are the number one cause of death in motorcycle accidents. Riding without adequate head protection not only increases the risk of serious injury or death, it increases the chances that a helmetless motorcyclist will become a burden on society. Mandatory use of U.S. DOT-approved full-face helmets will reduce deaths, reduce serious injuries, and save taxpayers millions. 5. Don't Vote/Don't Ride. Riding is not a right, it's a privilege granted by the government. While adults may choose to accept the inherent risk associated with motorcycle riding, minors cannot be expected to make rational decisions regarding their own safety. Like smoking, drinking, and other life-threatening activities, motorcycle riding isn't kid stuff. 6. Power Corrupts. Loss of control during full throttle application has become a common problem with ""sportbikes"". The horsepower race among motorcycle manufacturers has become sheer madness. Sportbikes have become virtually uncontrollable. Accidents caused by wheelstands and spinning rear tires even occur on race tracks with professional riders. No one can responsibly or legally use the horsepower available from current production motorcycles on public roads. It's time to put an end to the horsepower race and limit the power to weight ratio of motorcycles to that of typical passenger cars. 7. Speed Kills. No where in the country is it legal to drive a passenger car at more than 75 mph on public roads. There is no excuse for motorcycles designed to break the speed limit. Speed governor technology is simple and effective. It needs to be put in place immediately. 8. Stay in Control With Technology. Anti-skid braking systems have been available technology for many years, yet only a few motorcycles are equipped with ABS brakes. Given the inherent instability of single-track vehicles, ABS should be mandatory on all new motorcycles. Other design changes needed to improve motorcycle safety include ""deadman"" throttles and tipover bars. Using the same technology currently required on new lawn mowers, motorcycles should be designed so that the engine drops to idle whenever a hand is removed from the handlebars. This will prevent dangerous stunts like riding with no hands. Simple tipover bars will prevent crushed ankles and knees when the unavoidable tipover eventually occurs. This technology is already used on certain models like the Honda ST1300, a motorcycle that doesn't appeal to younger riders. Most models do not use tipover bar technology because it is considered like ""training wheels"" by more ""macho"" riders. 9. Give a Hoot, Don't Pollute. Despite their smaller size. Motorcycles are allowed to pollute over ten times more per mile of travel than passenger cars and light trucks. There's just no excuse for that; children and the elderly have to breathe the fumes emitted. All new cars and light trucks use catalytic converters and charcoal canisters to limit exhaust and evaporation emissions. Motorcycles should be required to use the same technology. 10. Save the Icecaps. Motorcycles are currently exempt from the Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards that apply to passenger cars and light-duty trucks. Yet many motorcycles actually have worse fuel economy than some passenger cars. Cars like the Honda Insight and Toyota Prius are achieving over 50 mpg, yet many motorcycles achieve less than 40 mpg. Low fuel economy means more carbon dioxide emissions, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. With the end of the motorcycle horsepower race, there is no reason that motorcycles can't be designed to use no more fuel than passenger cars on a per passenger basis. Since many cars and SUVs can carry six people and most motorcycles can carry only two people, motorcycles should be getting at least three times the 27.5 mpg standard that applies to cars. 82.5 mpg is a reasonable standard for all motorcycle manufacturers to achieve on a corporate average basis.",1,1,motorcycles,youthetom

Its about animatronics possessed by murdered children and the mysterious Bite of 87. TLT makes songs and Matpat make theories. SFM models and Gmod models are the norm, albeit stylized. FNAF 2 is teased as well as new mechanics. People are hyped. To our surprise, Scott releases the demo early before the game comes out. The plot is a prequel, with Toy animatronics and a new restaurant, ""Fredbear's Family Diner"" and gives a semi explanation for the Bite of 87. Scott's site is inactive before a teaser for FNAF 3 shows Golden Freddy is returning. On Christmas eve, the trailer drops. A few months later, the game is finally released. It is a sequel taking place at an amusement park. It gives closure on Fredbear's Diner and the Puppet. And just like that, FNAF is over. It becomes another once popular game like Slenderman.

I am a chef so I have worked my way up in the industry to get where I am and have a deep understanding of the waiter waitress position in restaurants. This is not coming from ignorance or jealousy its from sheer observation and first hand experience. Waiters and waitresses are over paid. There is no reason that any unskilled worker should make that much money. Many cooks I've worked with have started at 10$ an hour and every hour they get pelted with order after order literally running around trying to keep up, sweat on their brows working long shifts and due to the shortage of cooks in the US often picking up more shifts than they even want. Often being over worked to the point where they barely get one day off. waking up, going to work all day and night with no breaks only to be able to quickly scarf something down to get enough energy for the dinner rush that will definitely bury them. I'm not gonna shit all over you guys and detail every instance where most waitresses and waiters are lazy because when you all look at the line you know who the real workers of the restaurant are. The people who are highly skilled and trained to understand the food making processes to ensure a safe and delicious meal for all customers. These guys often have worked for years to get where they are performing dubious and dangerous tasks to create wonderful works of art only to make less money than the people who's job is to be fake happy to the customers and walk your creations out and scrape the plates (which often times they can't even do properly or even be courteous and stack plates for the poor dishwashers.) I was working this summer, I took over as the chef, for no raise I was worked 86 hours a week for 12$ an hour that meant 6 days a week I woke up and worked with no breaks until the time I slept. I was making roughly 900-1000$ a week only to have a waiter (my friend) come in front of my line and announce how his slowest week this summer he made 700$ BY ONLY WORKING 20 HOURS A WEEK!!!!! this wage gap is too far there is no reason that waiters should make that much. A local business owner recently went tip free which I applaud but now the local waiters and waitresses are taking to all of the review websites and posting nasty reviews trying to get them shut down because they don't want other local businesses to follow suit.

uid_946445,"Oh come on, at least ban beanies",2016-12,-1,"People should be allowed to wear what they want in public. I think a good argument could be made for keeping your bottom bits covered in most public places for reasons of hygiene and traditional decorum. Just as public toplessness should be supported for both sexes if they wish, equally if an individual wants to go about in a full burqa, why should it matter? I do think someone in burqa could be required to briefly expose their face for purposes of identification in situations that require it, like when making a bank transaction or during a traffic stop. There's a very legitimate compelling interest in both private and public parties requiring positive identification citizens, and comparing a face to a photo ID is the best technology we have so far. Beyond that, who cares? If you're in a Northern state in a winter storm, you cover your whole face from the elements. You cover your whole head with a full-faced motorcycle helmet if you're smart when you ride. We don't take offense at any of those face coverings. The only reason to ban the burqa is the worst -- ""we don't like seeing that kind of dress in our society"" so we're going to ban it. There's an important principle here -- many government entities over the years have tried to ban the wearing of saggy jeans that expose your boxers, for no other reason than simply disliking the people who wear them. When I was younger, the length of a young man's hair was a huge battleground. The point is, if we cede to the government authority to ban someone's clothing that we don't like, then what argument would you use if a government in turned banned two-piece bikinis, or long hair on men, or blouses that show cleavage, or the habit and wimple of a nun, or whatever else happened to offend the sensibilities of some people? It's a terrible idea to permit a ban on certain types of clothing or hairstyles or other matters of personal dress.

They've found the remains of baked apples in Iron Age Switzerland - no way they're becoming cider. Even in 1470 they were making a clear distinction between cooking and cider apples and sweet eating apples: ""Malus the Appyll tree is a tree yt bereth apples and is a grete tree in itself. . . it is more short than other trees of the wood wyth knottes and rinelyd Rynde.

If a lot of people don't think $20 for 3 shaders is rightly valued then the sales will be low, and they will lower their prices next time.

I know making a thread for this is probably useless, but I feel the need to do it anyways. Why is it that somebody's downvoted just for stating their opinions? I see it all the time, but more specifically on here. In topics like ""What is your favorite verse?"" or ""What is your favorite song?"" etc. it's more prominent. I saw one comment where the guy said he didn't like Big KRIT's verse on 1Train. That's fine, it's an opinion, you like it or you don't. But, of course he was at -20. Are we seriously not allowed to post opinions here? The downvote arrow is for people who aren't contributing to the topic. Even if the person's opinion differs from your own, it's still contributing. This isn't even a karma-related issue. I just hate that somebody can get so much negativity for disliking something that most others DO like. I really do enjoy lurking this sub everyday but I hate to see someone who is posting their thoughts and opinions be bashed on so harshly. I wouldn't be surprised if some people are actually hesitant to post anything due to this fact. I dunno, pointless rant.

More specifically, it seems like C:S automatically allocates a large chunk of memory to each thread on load, even if there's no more memory to allocate. It doesn't matter if the entire mod is blank. As long as it extends from ThreadExtensionBase, a fixed amount of memory is given to it. What this means is I should be able to dump 100 of these blank shells in a mod and crash the game every time. Here's the weird thing: if I do not compile the threaded classes, load a save game, and then recompile the mod with the threaded classes while the game is running, the game updates and runs fine. So, it's the save game loading process that's crashing out. Anyone know how to overcome this? Lazy loading doesn't help when a fixed amount of memory is allocated either way.

uid_526436,yeah man the princess nerf proved it all,2016-10,-1,"Supercell knows what they are doing with balancing If we look at the metas of the past in this game, we have had a lot of dominant metas. Including the hog rider freeze, mass defending buildings, royal giant, goison and maybe more. With the last patches supercell was able to create a more diverse meta. I can't think of any deck that is much scarier than any other decks right now. There is the lava hound, giant, hog rider, royal giant, cycle, golem, mortar, xbow and many more decks that are used a lot where I am currently in the ladder (around 4k). To add to this, I see many decks with legendaries and WITHOUT legendaries. I find its important that the legendaries should be good, but not necessary. They nerfed the zap spell so it would be less used but it is still used quite a lot. They are nerfing the ice spirit similarly to what they did to zap so that it becomes less used, but i believe it will change as much as the zap usage did when they nerfed it. They did that because these cards were/are overused. Unfortunately it is hard to balance such low cost cards that freeze troops. Although they weren't able to take zap out of the meta and probably won't take ice spirit out, they were able to make elixir collector a non necessary card in every deck (it must have been used more than 80% of the time and now it probably has less than 20%). Even if some people weren't really happy with the elixir collector change, it gives us a more healthy meta. Not only that, but a bit before they nerfed the poison to not slow anymore, they added the slowing effect to buildings for poison. When they did that no one thought it would make poison the best spell in the game. But they made a little error and then they fixed it. This post was really to remind people that supercell did an amazing job in balancing in the last patches. Even though they made a few errors previously, they respond by fixing those errors in later patches. Props to supercell for the amazing balance changed they previously did and for the upcoming one too.",-1,-1,ClashRoyale,Umair7860

So, a lot of theories have been made about TWOW being a new (out at least new to us) house. Most of these have centered around The Winds being a house of Others, but what if we got this wrong? A lot of ""theories"" about Jon Snow coming back, to join House Stark (or Targaryen), but what if House Wind of Winter is Jons new house? Let's look at it. Jon is, like all black brothers, bound to the watch for life, after having ""said the words"", but we all know ""words are wind""... Get it ""Wind"", so after being brought back to life Jon starts the new House Wind of Winter. Whether House Wind will take over TNW duties at the wall, giving that pretty much all honor are gone from them, and taking The Wall as it's home, or march south I'm not sure. But to me it makes sense (if R+L=J is not true). This would also mean that in the future, new brothers wouldn't just leave their old families, but join a new, making them ""true"" brothers of House Wind. TL;DR: House Wind is not Others, Jon Snow creates House Wind of Winter after being brought back to life.

uid_466683,"Listen a lot, maybe it will spark again.",2015-05,0,"Im trying to re-learn languages. How do i do this? Heres some context. I lived in 7 countries by the time i was 10 and my family had a rule that we would only speak the languages of whatever country we were living in so as a result i became a little linguist as a child. My parents are Canadian and British but Norwegian was my first language shortly followed by English and French. By the time i was 3 i was fully trilingual and equally versed in each and by the time i was 7 I had added Spanish bringing it to 4 languages. When i was 10 years old i was in an accident that gave me brain damage and shattered a lot of my memories/knowledge base. We moved to a small town on the island of Newfoundland where everyone speaks English and only english and I lived there until i was 18. Over that 8 year span i forgot all of my languages. I can still speak good conversational french even though i have issues with my vocabulary, verbs and distinguishing between masculine and feminine. In Norwegian i can string a few sentences together but its by no means a language i can communicate in anymore and I definitely can't read it. And Spanish is literally just enough to string together the 20 or so most popular phrases and understand keywords. Now I've been living on my own in Toronto for the last couple of years and I've made some Arab friends and they've been trying to teach me Arabic and all though its only hello, how are you, please and thank you sort-of-stuff plus enough to curse someone out quite nicely its been enough to re-kindle my love of language. Im interested in getting back to having my original three languages so i need to re-learn Norwegian and then re-master both Norwegian and French. What is the best way for me to go about doing this? With French especially i find i have very splintered knowledge in that my accent is perfect to the point that i can say some really large words and i can string together some phrases to the point that french people i meet don't realize I'm not a francophone but then they might say a simple word for a fruit or animal or something and my brain hits a 404 error and is completely unable to find the word in my vocabulary even though most french toddlers would use it in everyday speech.

uid_761780,I can't tell who I am more disappointed with OP: You for not keeping your brother's girlfriend on staff and fucking her or your Parents for not teaching you how to properly ruin a human being's life.,2015-02,0,"I fired my brother today, AND IT FELT GREAT!!! So to give you a little back story. My parents have had a construction company for over 22 years.They have over 34 full-time employees. So as you can guess they have a pretty good size company. Every now and then I would come work for them as a supervisor or foreman. I ended working for a few start-up companies and a few building maintenance companies just to get some more experience in building construction. My brother on the other hand, has never held a job in his life. He's 22, didn't graduate high school, has no plans to go to college and him and his girlfriend live with my parents. He has spent the past four years of his life ""working"" for my parents business. He also persuaded my dad to hire his girlfriend for secretary and office work. Now we all know about the horrible things he has done to the company. Recently we caught him stealing over 5,000$ a month by having his girlfriend write him a company check. Every so often when our payroll lady was sick his girlfriend would take over for the day. To this day he has stolen over 36,000$. My parents just swept it under the rug and pretended like it never happened. He would come in to the office and start yelling at the employees for not saving ""his"" parking spot. Our office is located in a commercial building with multiple tenants. No one has saved or assigned parking. But there is one spot in particular under a tree that he likes to park his truck under. A few years back he go mad at my dad and went out to our lot and slashed all our company truck tires. He stoled a company truck one year and got really drunk and ended up crashing it into another vehicle. My parents ended up paying over 100,000 to the person he hit. He even flipped an employees desk over because he didn't get out of the bathroom quick enough when my brother had to use it. We ended up paying for a brand new iMac for the employee and new iPad since they where his personal ones and they broke when my brother flipped the desk. Now some people might ask ""Why did your parents allow him to do any of those things?"" My dad would always say ""He's my son, he has no where else to go, otherwise if he didn't have me, he would be sleeping under a bridge."" But the part that got to me the most, the thing that made me mad the most, was when my brother told his girlfriend of three years that as soon as he got the company, he was going to sell it and move to Hawaii. My father spent 22 years of his hard work, tears and blood building this company, and he just wants to sell it to collect the money and move away leaving so many people unemployed and families without food. Well last month my father called me and asked me to come by the office. He sat me down and said ""Whosaidmr, we have come to decision, your mother and I are going to give you the company, we believe that it will be best in your hands since you have more business experience than your brother and you know the business"". I could not believe to tell you how excited I was. I didn't even think of them ever giving me the company. And right when my dad said those words the only thing I could think about is ""The first thing I'm going to do is fire my brother"". So yesterday after a month long process of signing all the corporate documents and bank accounts in my name (without my brother finding out) we finally finalized everything with our lawyer. I was now the proud owner of a construction company. A well established and well know company. My father and mother would collect 10% of the companies monthly earnings until the last one of them dies. Then after that the 10% would go into a private savings account to be scattered among all the grandchildren when the last one turns 18. Today was my first day in my new office. And today was the day I knew I was going to fire my brother. Upon arriving to the office I decided to park in ""His"" parking spot. I went up to my office, sat in my chair, and waited. I waited almost 3 hours till he finally showed up 2 hours late. I can hear him come into my office thinking that its still my dads office. As soon as he opens the door and sees me he says, ""What the fuck are you doing in here faggot?"" ""No, the questing you should be asking is what the fuck your doing coming into my office without knocking"" I said to him. ""Your office, are you fucking stupid? You don't work here, this is dads office"" he replied. "" Not anymore according to this document"" I said as I handed him the forms stating that I was now the owner. He started to look and read the documents, his face turned white as if he's seen a ghost. I could see his anger is his face, and he started to clench his fist. He ripped the papers and threw them right into the air screaming ""You fucking backstabber, this is supposed to be my company, you took it from me, your own brother, you took the company from your only brother, I have no where else to work, I have no skills and no where else to go"" he said. ""Im not going to sell the company like you are, dad figured that it would be best to leave it in my hands, but what I can tell you is that yes your right, you have no skills, you have no where else to go, no one else will hire you, and i feel pity for you that you never realized that sooner, but you where a very big expense to mom and dad, your stole money, you destroyed company property, we lost big contracts because of you and how you act on job sites, so for that I have no pity or feelings, and I don't care what you do with your life, but I can't tell you one thing, something that has had a long time coming, something that should have happened sooner, your fired, and your girlfriend is fired too, get the fuck out of my office"" I said. Now at this moment he was mad, he was really angry, I could see it in his face and body. He was about to charge at me and just as I predicted he ran right at me with his fist. Luckily I predicted that this could happen so I asked some of my foreman who showed up early to stay outside the office incase they need to help escort him out. As soon as they heard him running towards me they ran into the office and tackled him to the ground. They picked him up as he was kicking and screaming and threw him out the front door. That was about six hours ago and I haven't seen him or heard from him since. He did call my dad and my dad called me to tell me ""The business is yours, you can hire and fire whoever you want."" My brothers girlfriend didn't come into work either, not surprising, but Im sure she got the message.",5,5,offmychest,Malphael

What I saw and many with me was a complete disrespect for proper ethics and disclosure by Nathan G. Yes there where no review but that was also quickly dismissed. Though some still like to claim GGers still believe there where. It only demonstrates that some people are stuck in the initial situation. Nathan still pushed and wrote about ZQ several times without disclosing their friendship. Something that obviously is up for debate but from the view of proper journalism, no. From that view there is no debate. At the very least he should disclosed his friendship. Worth noting is that Nathan G. have done this not only with ZQ but also with others on quite a few occasions. Something that wasn't known at the start but goes to show that there really where a reason to looking into it. But there are so much more crap but it isn't related to the start. But I do think that some peoples obsessiveness of female victims and harassment do severely diminish their capability to see what has been going on. I know it is pointless to speculate but I can't help but wonder what GG would have looked like if there where no females involved at all in the initiating event.

I've been dealing with depression for a while and it recently got bad again. I'm through the worst of it now, but one thing that allowed me to come through to the other side was that I decided to have my brother hang on to my handgun while I was in the thick of it. I live in a rougher city, but ultimately realized I the gun I had WAS NOT MAKING ME SAFER. And I think that's a critical distinction to make, if your gun isn't keeping you safe, consider letting it go for the time being. I'll take ownership of it again at a later time when I'm feeling better, in a real crisis I could still get ahold of it. For now I get to concentrate on getting better, without some moment of despair fucking that up.

We get it, he's not in *exactly* the perfect place yet. He's often been OP, generally a top-tier priority, with some brief moments of either good balance or shit-tier (though he's been mostly fine the last few weeks). His talent diversity isn't always 100% optimal. He can always use some more tweaking. But there are over 50 other heroes in this game, many of whom have received minimal or no changes in months and need significantly more work than KT does. How many times was KT changed before a single balance change was made to Dehaka? When was the last time Murky got a significant talent change, despite now being hard countered by half the hero pool? Four out of five of Nazeebo's level 4 talents are generic ones, and while I know you're in the process of a rework he could at least use *something* there. Poor Hammer had lost her will to live ever since we got to two powerful mages that countered her, and now there are *four*. Tassadar has basically negative talent diversity.

I know you guys are busy and always trying to make the game better, but at this point it isn't even about how balanced or unbalanced the character is, just how much freaking work goes into him as opposed to pretty much any other hero in the game. Yes, we hear that reworks are coming. Yes, we see other heroes getting minor tweaks. But it's become a joke at this point that KT can't go more than a patch without tweaks or it might break the game somehow. So give it a rest for, like, three patches at least. Please. He's fine. Is he perfect? No, but he's *fine*, and there are a *lot* of heroes in this game who aren't and need your attention far more urgently. Please, give it to them and let poor KT rest for a bit.

uid_776211,"This autistic person is very, VERY pissed off at that mom right now!",2013-05,0,"I used to work in a big department store. There was a woman who would bring her extremely autistic son in. She had him on one of those child-harness things (i.e. a leash), but she never bothered to actually hold on to the harness, so he would wander freely through the store while she browsed. When she decided it was time to go, she would want through the store yelling his name at the top of her voice. Seriously, let me paint the picture for you: I would be standing there, casually folding shirts like a good little worker bee, absorbed in what I was doing (gotta fold those shirts nice and perfect, don't want any wrinkles, no sir). Suddenly, without warning, from DIRECTLY behind me, would be a shout of: ""PAULIE!! PAAAAUUUULIIIIEEE!!"" Mini heart attack, I swear. Have you ever seen the movie Babe, when Magda Szubanski's character would call out, ""Heeeeerrreee, pig pig pig!""? Something like that. She would keep this up, wandering the store screaming his name until she found him. Here's the clincher: This kid had been found by various people - staff and general public - in extremely odd and/or dangerous places. One time, he had wandered off to the bank down the street. One time, we found in our service lift trying to climb a trolley full of boxes that had been left in there. One time, a customer dragged him to our front desk, in tears because he had just pulled Paulie off the busy main street outside the store (it's a major road through a largish country town, and it's the only road to the city so it gets a lot of traffic). No matter how many people yelled at her, no matter how many times security/police/child services were called, she always came back and she always did the same thing.

If she's saying that participating in any cultural phenomenon that didn't entirely originate in your own family's society is cultural appropriation, then about 95% of anything we do, ever, including the vast majority of anything these extremists try to claim others shouldn't be doing or using or wearing or experiencing, are cultural appropriation on *their* part in the first place. In other words, either *everything* is cultural appropriation, or nothing is. The very nature of culture and society is that it borrows from others. Just like literature, nothing is totally original anymore. Or, more likely, if you are labeled as a member of a group that's not at the top of the privilege food chain, then cultural appropriation doesn't apply to you anyway. Because you can't do anything wrong if you don't have power in a certain society. That's how that works. I'm gonna rip my hair out.

These men in power also crafted religion, politics, and media, and their strong hold only loosened in the last few decades. Red Pillers bitch all the time that women are helpless and unable to problem solve. They also base a lot of theory on women's indecisiveness and indirect communication styles. As a Feminist I posit that these traits are due to nurture, not nature, and they put us at a disadvantage in many social interactions, and in many fields.

uid_305677,sometimes theres only 2 items in boss rush theres supposed to be 4 i cry every time,2016-01,0,"Afterbirth Imbalances I just sort of want to rant about this as I've been thinking it more and more as I play the game I really enjoy the game, I'm so very close to 1001% completion (just 3 keeper things and items to find) but ever since Afterbirth came out I can't help but notice how poorly balanced some aspects of the game have become I'm going to start with something that is debatably down to personal opinion, but the blue worm spawners are just bullshit, they are incredibly tanky, the things they generate are incredibly tanky AND charge you down, they spawn them at the same rate the others spawn flies (an enemy that will take at most 2 hits to kil as opposed to like 7 or 8), they move about avoiding you and then when you finally kill it there's a very good chance 1 or 2 more of the blue things will spawn. Now you're in a room with 4 of them, they've all spawned one worm, this room will now take you around 48 tears (that land!) to clear assuming they don't spawn any more worms (which they will). Bad enough, right? Oh but wait, you're in one of those rooms that is just a square ring with 1 of them in each corner, the 2 on your side spawn 1 each which both them charge at you. Guess what! Literally nothing you can do! You can't run away because there's nowhere to run! Now they're both running into you, you're losing health, and you still can't do shit about it because the room hasn't magically changed, and now those bastards are shooting out more worms. I fucking hate them. Moving on, Krampus, he can now spin his lil brimstone bullshit, wonderful. This wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for the fact that if he ends up against a wall, you can't fucking avoid it, he spins, you move with it, oh wait there's a wall in your way and now you've been hit by his laser, literally nothing you can do about it. The Forsaken who has this same function will move into the middle of the room before doing this so you can actually avoid it (unless you're in an L room which is another pile of bullshit) but this was clearly not actually given any thought with Krampus who someone just slapped the buff button on. Small rooms. Or thin rooms. Any room that funnels. Here's a boss that flings bombs that leave creep. Oh look he's spamming his creep explosion. You're now completely locked in and all it took was the first bomb! The second one just landed straight on you! Literally nothing you can do about it. Or here's 2 Monstros in the tiniest room, have fun. Now you're on the chest and you're in a corridor and here's 6 Monstros! They're all just hopping over to you so there's no room to dodge! All such fun! PHD! Basically useless. All those 'neutral' pills that are actually hugely detrimental don't get removed. Sure you don't get the stat downs, but when the alternative is a pill that means you can have both curse of the lost and curse of the maze on a giant dark room layout, I don't think that's smart. Sure, you can avoid it now (if you can remember the ??? doesn't mean you don't know what the pill is) but why is it still in the pool? Because there's no positive counterpart? Just fucking remove it! And oh, look, a pill that causes some people to feel nauseous playing the game, wonderful, I bet that was really planned out with beta testers. Hush. Cool boss design, everything about the fight is really well done, except the health. I understand the idea of the extra hard boss, the bullet hell style of fight, but 90% of the time it's a tedious slog, you can kill him, you know you can kill him, you can dodge the hits, it's just a matter of time, but the time is the issue because it's taking you 5 minutes to kill one thing. This is probably a preference issue but it's incredibly off putting, when you actively don't look forward to something in a game, and not because you're scared it'll kill you, that's likely not a good thing. Angel Rooms. When you have a room that requires some very, very specific criteria to be met to unlock it, you'd expect the contents of said room to be pretty good, right? 3 pennies. Holy Water. 4 spirit hearts behind 4 locks. I'm so glad I ignored Brimstone, Mom's Knife, and Incubus for this. When people will literally throw health away on a permanent level just to get precedent and never ever have to deal with this room, it's not that impressive. Oh I avoided taking any damage on this entire labyrinth floor that didn't drop any soul hearts, killed 2 bosses, and I get an Angel Room, I sure hope Sacred Heart or Godhead is in here! Nah, it's Holy Water. At least it's free! Oh wait I'm The Lost it's literally nothing. And now Devil Deals will never ever turn up again for some reason. (??????) You want to fight Mega Satan (so of course the path to do this gives you exclusively shit items and money) and you've managed to meet the criteria to unlock an Angel room, RNG was on your side and you feel like the completed key piece may eventually be yours, so you go into the room, and it's tiny, super Jesus spawns and proceeds to just buttfuck you into oblivion because he's kinda fast and there's nowhere to run. Somehow you come out on top with 1/2 a heart left and your key piece. Cue the rest of the run not giving you an Angel room because the arbitrary retarded rollercoaster that is the reasoning behind its generation decided you deserved nothing. Cheers game. Rag Man. Why is a boss who fires homing shots (of which the first shot of 4 I swear is a Sacred Heart homing shot) by the fucking dozen able to spawn these spiders that are considerably more tanky than your average spider? At least you can still hurt him while dealing with them temporarily, right? Wrong. He's just upped and decided to spawn 2 of them immediately for literally no reason, and now he's doing it again. Thanks buddy. Greed Mode. A fantastic mix up of the original formula, really love the mode and the idea of it. First floor, first wave, just black flies for like 3 spawns, easy! Not entirely sure why it's a wave but hey not complaining. Next wave, it's those bigger than the smaller spiders that spawn 2 spiders when they die, except there's like 6 of them. Next wave is the same thing, except you haven't dealt with the first ones. You've already been hit, you're Judas, there's nothing you can do except try fighting this ever growing horde of tanky bullshit. Super secret rooms. Why are there just spikes and literal shit in here? Were these rooms that could consist of nothing but hearts or pills that, as we've already discussed, will literally eat your face and cripple you, too good? Did they need to be nerfed? Rooms with fire or spikes right in front of you as you enter them. Why is that a good idea? Do you want people to slowly plod through the game by pausing as they enter each room? The fucking Boss Rush rooms with spikes around the items. Why are items constantly being put behind rocks and spikes? I have no health, or bombs, so now I just can't get an item. The rooms where it happens honestly look shoddy, like the game sort of bugged out for a second. With Boss Rush in particular, what's the fucking point? You already got there in 20 minutes, you met the fairly tight constraints to unlock the 'secret' and now you can't do anything with it. You get there as the Keeper? Enjoy not being able to get hit for the entire event. It's really like you're the original version The Lost! But worse somehow! The fact that some items completely fuck over others you pick up. It's got to the point where I will google item combos to make sure what I'm about to pick up doesn't break the game, and not in a good way. Ludo and Explosivo to name one, literally game losing the moment they collide. There's other shit but I've written a whole bunch of words that few are likely to read, I just wanted to rant because it irks me, the original seemed so much more balanced in comparison, this feels like they just threw shit at the wall to see what stuck and then kept the stuff that didn't stick in it anyway.

Alright so I've had the idea of starting up a LoL team for awhile, and just watching the S2 Championships as made me decide to push forward with that idea. I've had semi-successful teams in the past on other games, and feel I can transition that to LoL. What I mean by semi-successful is that no one on the team was over 18, and we weren't able to viably travel without guardians, and it basically ended because of that. Anyways, I know pretty much what I'm looking for, in that the qualities of players. * Be able to work as a team * Take criticism * Add constructive criticism when needed * Suggest new ideas to help the team grow * Be from North America I'm not sure what else I'm missing aside from that, so if anyone can suggest anything, I will add it to my list. Positions I will be looking for: * ADC * Support * Jungler * Top/Mid* *The reason for not needing one of those specifically is those are the too roles I find myself most comfortable in, and feel I am able to help the team the most. If anyone wants any background on me: When I first started playing LoL, like many other people, it was all about ADC'ing. While playing with friends I got forced into many different roles, and constantly bickered at for others faults. For example, if anyone died, it was my fault, and if we lost, it was my fault...even when I was the only one who went positive. Regardless, I found my comfort spot, and that's solo-lanes; whether it be top or mid. **Will there be ELO requirements to join?** Simple answer, no. Longer answer, ELO doesn't define your true skill as a member of a team. Especially if you queued with bad players, or just got bad teams, or trolls on your team. *Example: I queued my first 3 ranked games solo, and won them. After those I queued with my friend who had 700 ELO...I regret it to say the least.*",1,1,leagueoflegends,Captain_Teemo

That explanation just didn't sit right with me, but I swallowed it and tried to accept it. Then, it turned out to be a forgery and everyone was like, ""See, there's no talking salamanders and the Church is still true,"" and they conveniently forgot about the knots they were twisting themselves in to try and make it all make sense. After that, everyone quickly dropped the subject and seemed to want to pretend the whole thing never happened. I remember having an empty, let-down feeling that I now know was cognitive dissonance.

I watched this movie last night, which I often heard as being a great, a classic, a must-watch and...maybe I didn't get it? I didn't think it was bad, I just don't honestly see why it was great. Burt Reynolds apparently gave an award-winning performance, but I don't see how it was better than Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, or Philip Seymour Hoffman. I can't honestly say I was impressed with Mark Wahlberg in this movie either; all of the scenes where he tried to be tough just ended up making me wince a little. And I think I understand this movie's synthesis, it was showing the human element of people in the pornography business, and how mundane things like sex, drugs, and violence become in those spheres but why was this groundbreaking? Didn't Pulp Fiction do something remarkably similar (and arguably better) three years earlier? There were times when this movie felt to me like it stitched together all the parts of what a great gritty movie typically has, but the actual plot connecting those elements felt thin and insubstantial. The dialogue was awkward half the time and several moments that looked like they should've been meaningful never actually developed or *became* meaningful (you could say this makes the movie nihilistic, but again, why is that special?). And this isn't to say I didn't enjoy it at all. It had funny moments, a great soundtrack, some cool performances, interesting instances of camera-work. I just feel like I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. So, I guess I feel like I missed something and I'd appreciate it if somebody could show me why this movie deserves more credit than I'm giving it.",0,0,movies,dildog

Luke briefly looks up and squints. ""We are not alone"". All of a sudden, the door bursts open, Luke and Rey jumping to the ready. As the smoke clears, all of your fears in the world are culminated into this moment. The pit of your stomach has seemingly fallen into a yet deeper pit of dark matter that has never existed before. You blink and shake you head, but there is no mistaking it. ""MESSA FINALLY FOUND ANI'S SON"". Screams break out over the theatre. A fire quickly begins in the upper section, seeming caused by the projector trying to reject what it had just displayed. You hear and feel a swift ""Crack"". You wake up 9 months later in the hospital. Apparently what you saw, combined with someone hitting you with an arm of a theatre chair, made you slip into a coma. You ask what has happened since you went out and come to find out that the world had dipped into chaos after the launch of the movie. There is no government, only three warring factions; People who are not Star Wars fans (most of which have been killed off), the majority group of people who are meticulously trying to remove all pieces of the last episode and the prequels from existence, and a small, underground group that have come to worship the orange, long eared devil, seemingly driven mad. All the while, Disney Studios is barred up, filming the next episode. Some believe it was their doing to make an attempt at world domination, while some believe they just want everything to die.

uid_786323,an actual PSA in here while the joke PSA is upvoted.,2015-07,0,"From one formerly super stinky nerd to another, this is how to not stink like a cliche stinky nerd. TL/DR: Wash your damn clothes, don't wear the same clothes two days in a row. Let me preface this by saying, naturally, I sweat profusely, probably more than you've ever met, and I stink BAD. I noticed it was a problem, so I had to adapt and change some lifestyle habits. Here are some simple things you might not do that will make you stink significantly less. This is also good advice for you mid-teens going through the super-stank phase. 1 - When you shower, actually SCRUB your pits with whatever shower scrub you use. For heavier dudes, also scrub your very lower back (this is where a lot of that ass-stank builds up, it's not actually ass, it's the fold between your ass and your lower back). 2 - Apply deodorant immediately after showering (after drying of course) 3 - WEAR A CLEAN SHIRT. No point doing all that, and then putting on a slightly stinky shirt. Don't sniff your shirt and think 'oh that's ok'. It's not. Just because you can't smell it, doesn't mean you don't stink. In summer, unless you're sitting in air-con all day, you should definitely be washing your shirts after a whole day's wear. 4 - Again, wash your god damn shirts. I know many stinky people that shower daily, but they don't wash their clothes anywhere near often enough. You're thinking, 'at TI where am I going to do laundry?' In the hotel/hostel/your friend's place bathroom sink. Fill the sink with water, get a bar of soap, soak your shirt, get it a little soapy, scrub the pits with the bar of soap. Rinse, ring, hang somewhere. This takes 2-3 minutes per shirt. Now you can wear this shirt 1 or 2 days later depending on how fast it dried. In fact while I travel, I do this while I am in the shower. Bonus less stank points: If you are going to be out all day, and are going to have a small backpack, pack a change of shirt, and a small packet of wet wipes. In the early afternoon, go to a bathroom, use wet wipes to wipe down your pits and wherever else need, apply more deodorant, then put on a new shirt. It's like a mini shower (DO NOT DO THIS AS A SHOWER SUBSTITUTE). Bonus 2: If you're a dude that stinks no matter what you do, try clipping your arm-pit hair, it takes 10 seconds, and no, it's not gay. If you have a lot of hair there, and you have some BO, there's probably a lot that's sitting in the hair, and won't wash out. A lot of wrestlers and other athletes who are sweating for large portions of the day do this for this reason. You can live almost infinitely off 3-4 shirts doing this. It's easy, and it will make you stink incredibly less, almost no stink at all.",12,12,DotA2,sterob

Not, like, ""yay, I got it all figured out"" or ""yay, life is bearable and I look forward to continuing it for another 30-60 years"" but better. I took Sprinkles around the lake. She smiled at everyone, and I find this adorable. I've been working on my posture and it's kind of more natural to look at people when your back is straight and your body isn't tilted forward. So I figured I might as well smile if I'm going to go through all this trouble 'cause sometimes you can start acting cheerful and your mood catches up a little (only works on days where being cheerful even sounds fun. Trust me, some days it doesn't). Anyhow couple of cute ladies smiled at me and the doggie while jogging past and that was nice. Still about 95% of people completely and conspicuously avoided eye contact. To each their own, but it is kind of depressing in its own right how distant people are. I think the only thing I actually said on the 2.8 mile walk full of the kinds of people who aren't working on a Thursday was a laughing ""that's okay"" when somebody else's furmonster lunged at mine to say hi and they apologized. Achievements unlocked: * Smiled at human being and received return smile * Walked farther than the minimum required for sustenance * Exercised an overwhelmingly bouncy and happy puppy dog * Did not die Upcoming: * Plan for when sick days run out and I have to actually quit my job * Plan for when lease runs out and I have no job * Plan for getting another job * Plan for organizing my apartment enough that several dozen things don't ""live"" on the counter. * Plan for constructing a social life * Plan for finding and seducing attractive women and/or finding a happy relationship.",2,2,CFBOffTopic,thelittleking

The key is establishing dominance and disinterest over the situation, either by walking away or other means. Avoid any provocation and don't let anything get to you, you won't have to fight. That's pretty much the only intelligent thing you can do in that kind of situation. Letting what the other person says or does get to you will only make it worse, and once you get down this way, the fight is inevitable.",0,0,everymanshouldknow,SouthernSmoke

uid_104718,Aren't you forgetting to mention the effect overstaffing has on the poor staff who turn up to work only to be told they then have to go home early?,2014-06,0,"Here's another great example of shit that sounds like a good idea but is shit because its a lot more complicated than that. One of the biggest reasons that this concept will never work in changing an entire industry is that restaurants, in general, have one of the highest ratios of labor to revenue meaning that it takes more workers to provide ""x"" amount of sales than most any other industry. So this ""solution"" puts a lot more pressure (than there already is) on accurately forecasting how busy you will be any given night and staffing appropriately, (which is difficult in any business). Some of the factors that determine how busy a restaurant will be are things like the weather, events, randomness, and those can't be accurately predicted. With the current system of tipping it adds much more flexibility because you can err on the overstaffing side and cut workers as the night goes on. With a new system, managers will have to err more on the understaffing side because if you overstaffed consistently, the restaurant may be 10 slow nights a year from failing. This chronic understaffing can be seen in almost any other service business which is fine at places like McDonald's because shitty service is expected. American restaurants on the other hand can't afford this because decent service is expected by most, and the rest expect even better service. The average American diner has come to expect a living person to greet you immediately when walking in, and that a server will greet you within 5 minutes of sitting down, at any given time-this takes an adequate sized staff something that will probably not happen without the tipping system. In countries where there is no tipping, the customer waits on the pace of the server. tl;dr Tipping is not perfect but is necessary to provide the level of service that the average American diner expects. And can barely satisfy the most demanding 10% of your customers, who usually write more reviews/yelps than the other 90% and can determine whether or not a restaurant stays open. Get rid of tipping and the American dinning experience (which is best in the world, overall) will become much worse than having to tip a living human wages.",1,1,offbeat,RockDrill

I don't know if it's ok to post this here, as I'm not a reddit user, so I understand if this gets flagged (a co-worker recommended trying it, though). I'm planning an insanely elaborate scavenger hunt -- the kind where you follow a bunch of clues and run around the city (Chicago in this instance). It's for my friend who is currently living in Des Moines. One of my clues will lead to an ATM machine, and part of the ""clue package"" or whatnot will be an ATM receipt from the bank she uses. In this case, West Bank -- specifically, the Urbandale branch. There are a bunch of online services that will let you create fake ATM receipts (mostly as a way to impress ladies in bars). But I want it to look as authentic as possible, because I want her to think it's hers. And to do that I need to actually see what a West Bank ATM receipt looks like. Unfortunately, you can't find those outside of the Des Moines metro. I can't ask the friend, because the scavenger hunt is a surprise and I can't think of a plausible excuse for asking her. I don't really know anyone else living there. So what I need is someone who is a West Bank customer to hit a West Bank ATM and send me a picture of the front and the back of your receipt. Obviously - OBVIOUSLY - black out/obscure your personal information(!!!) I'm just interested in the layout of the receipt so that I can create a template from it using PhotoShop. The Urbandale branch is preferable, but really any branch is fine -- all that really matters is that you're a West Bank customer (as some banks print them out differently for customers) and that it's an actual WB terminal, not some grocery store ATM using a West Bank card. (I swear this isn't part of some elaborate fraud. I'm not sure what fraud you could commit with an ATM receipt, seeing as how people usually toss them into the trash or on the floor right next to the machine. So if I really wanted to commit some crime, I guess I could go pull them out of the trash cans next to gas station ATMs.) ANYWAY - for people's troubles I'm willing to pay $20!",6,6,desmoines,paseo1997

People make it sound like they'd respect the police more if they died more. You do understand that their job is to protect you, right? The fact that they don't have the highest death rate in the nation suggests that they're doing something right. Apparently lumberjacks have the deadliest occupation. They often die as a result of a tree falling. Many of them also narrowly escape, but the difference is that if a cop narrowly escapes death, or witnesses a fellow officer die, then they are much more likely to experience post-traumatic stress disorder. I'll tell you what would bother my dad. Showing up to crime scenes and seeing a dead child. It's especially difficult for a parent to have to deal with that shit, almost on a weekly basis. Even if it wasn't a small child, it was *somebody's* child or loved one, and police officers have to break the news to the families. Lumberjacks do not deal with the emotional stress that comes with being a police officer. Lumberjacks don't come home and shave off their facial hair because they can't get the stench of a dead body out of it. Lumberjacks don't spend countless hours searching for a missing child. Lumberjacks don't deal with the stress involved in hostage situations. Lumberjacks didn't rush into the Twin Towers on 9/11.

I voted Bernie and I'm a great believer in liberal political agendas and their power to make the world a better place, like many of us on Reddit. But these protests and riotous behaviors make America, liberals, and millennials look so bad. We condemn the right for attacking and stonewalling Obama at every turn, yet turn around and do the exact same thing when Trump wins office. This is how American Democracy works, whether we like it or not, whether the system is broken or not, this is how it is and these people must accept that. Furthermore, maybe if the millennial generation would get to the polls with as much vigor and enthusiasm as they are using to riot and protest, perhaps then Trump wouldn't have won. I don't believe for a second that even 80% of these protestors voted against Trump or even voted in general. What a sad time in America. I don't want a Trump presidency, but I respect that he is our president and we need to come together as a country for once and work together. Stop rioting and start trying to set an example like Obama tried to and be bi-partisan, work with the Republicans.

Let's set an example here, rather than simply falling to the level of GOP over the past eight years, rioting and stonewalling the President at every turn, it will only set us back further.",-7,-1,PublicFreakout,mijamala1

However apart from William Morris and a few literary figures like Proust and Tolstoy he didn't seem to have much of a legacy. Socialism in the 20th century seems dominated by the Industry focused Marxism.

(NSFL) This happened years ago when I was in college, and still haunts me to this day. I had been casually dating a girl for a few months, not being careful enough, and she became pregnant. She decided she was going to keep the baby. We were both terrified because we were still in college, not committed, and not at all ready for that. A few days after taking multiple pregnancy tests, we were having sex and something just didn't feel right. The texture was different, kind of like anal, but...sticky, and chunky. I pulled out and looked down and saw this bloody substance all over my junk, my stomach, and the bed. Neither of us had any idea what it was, and didn't think much of it, assuming it was period remnants or something. A few days later she went to the doctor to get a checkup on the pregnancy. When she came back and told me the news, it was then that I realized that the substance covering my body, and her sheets, was my miscarried child.",2,2,tifu,simon_guy

uid_987215,You are the reason Blizz won't discount character services.,2016-07,0,"I didn't think I was until a few weeks ago. I played a hunter back in Vanilla and BC and swapped to Mage in the middle of BC. My Mage's name was Bausfight and my Hunter was named Kyudo until I changed it to Minibaus. My Mage became my main up until the middle of Pandaria. I LOVED my Mage. He was just fun to play. And I loved his name as well. Couldn't get enough of my Mage. But I never considered myself ""attached"" to him because I had many, MANY alts. However, I swapped to a Windwalker Monk about halfway through Pandaria and he became my main. The class was INCREDIBLY fun to play. Even Brewmaster tanking was a lot of fun. During MoP I decided to swap servers. My Monk was the first to go and I decided to name him Bausfight since he was main now. Slowly but surely I swapped all of my guys over to the new server, everybody keeping their names (priest named Sidequest - white cow druid named Crazygloo - Hunter still named Minibaus - Rogue named Faeus... nothing funky for the the Rogue... sorry... - and the rest of them too). However, when it came time to switch my Mage over, I had to think of a new name. I came up with Abracadavra. So I kept leveling up my alts one by one to 100. My Mage was the last one that I had swapped and gotten to 100 which was a few weeks ago. The whole time leveling and gearing I was having a blast! I had forgotten how fun it was to play my Mage! But it also felt... off... Doing the dailies on my alts and then logging in on my Monk with the name Bausfight and then my Mage... it didn't feel right... Then as I got my gear and relearning how to play my Mage, I finally snapped and was like, ""NOPE! That's it! Sorry Monk... you're great and all, but my MAGE is the one and only Bausfight!"" So a quick name swap and my Mage is once again my main with the name Bausfight. And my Panda Monk has resided to the name Yenji. Those few weeks of playing my mage and having another character have his name made me realize how much I love the Mage class and that no matter what, even with a little slight detour, my Mage will always be my main. He's the Baus. And always will be. #magemasterrace",4,4,wow,zook388

T: 11:55 Increased pupil dilation, feeling giggly as fuck, super excited can't sit still. decide to go outside for a cigarette, out trip sitter followed us because he was worried. Sat in the courtyard of out student halls, the buildings around us started breathing, the flowers in the flower pots seemed to grow larger as we looked at them, they looked like they were blocking right before our eyes, the soil they were planted in had a pulse, like it was pumping blood into the plants. T: 12:44 simple actions have become difficult, slight vegetative state, spent too long lying on my bed staring at the shadows on the ceiling that seemed to change into new images, such as a deer, an indian man, and frank from Donnie Darko. Stuart has a piece of my hair, apparently it's amazing, he looses it, i give him several more pieces of hair. He said he couldn't fathom in his mind that the more hair he had, the more stuff that would happen. Decide to eat an ice lollie. T: 1:00 Flat mate is tripping balls, he can't stop laughing, he looks like an old Chinese lady in the corner of my eye. He decides he wants to eat some grapes so he washes them in the sink, he takes the packaging off and drips of water start falling from the packaging, he panics thinking he is dropping loads of tiny grapes everywhere. I'm moving my hands around, i can see my hands several frames behind, like i'm seeing where my hands were literally milliseconds before as well as seeing them where they were now. Decide to eat an ice lollie. T: 1:45 decide to go out for another cigarette, not because i feel the need to smoke, but because i want to go on an adventure, decided to wear my dressing gown, because that way i definitely have to come back??? Feel anxious leaving the music and the lamp that makes the pretty shadows behind, Stuart (Flatmate) tells me it's ok, we don't need it because he's wearing his sunglasses??? Alois asks if we have keys to get back in, i tell him yes, he tells me he doesn't believe in the existence of my keys, forgets, brings grapes with him. T: 2:00 Alois is in his room in the dam listening to sweet valley, he said he can feel the music like and electric plus travelling through his head. Me and Stuart Have sex. Hands own best sex of my life, like fuck, i could feel every inch of him surrounding me, it felt primal and incredible. I mean, if any one saw it, it was come very vanilla sex, like, straight up missionary for like forty minutes, but it felt amazing, and i didn't want to not be able to see his face, it felt so close and safe. didn't cum, didn't care. Decide to get up and eat an Ice lollie. T 3:00 decided to find Alois. find him in his room in the dark, lay and talk about life, the meaning of it, and how everything seems so simple on acid, like i revert back to a stage of child like wonder, everything is new and amazing, i want to be on acid forever. T: 4:00 decided to eat and Ice lollie. Convince Alois to eat a scotch bonnet pepper, he does. decided to make food, have a really satisfying time chopping a tomato, like too satisfying, like really satisfying. get out a bell pepper, take a bite, crunch sounds amazing, everyone wants to crunch the pepper. sit at table passing round a pepper for half an hour, forget to cook food. Eat an Ice lollie. T: 5:00 go back to my room, we watch some Cyriak videos, listen to some suicide sheep mixes and some more sweet valley whilst watching the shows dance around, we talk about life some more, about epiphanies we have had whilst on acid, i never want to not be on acid. T:7:00 Finally coming down, shadows are slowing, i'm getting sleepy, i can tell i'm coming down, because i'm starting to worry about really stupid everyday stuff, like that thing i said the other week and whether people i don't like think i'm a nice person. sleep it off. since then i have been generally quite down, on acid is the happiest i have ever been and i don't want to go back to life not on acid, real life terrifies me, and i don't see the point in it if you're just spending your whole life just trying not to be unhappy. TL;DR : Ate a whole pack of 18 twister lollies.",4,4,Drugs,StevenHB

IT pisses me off how assholes like you cant keep their mouths shut and always have to force your opinion on others. Just because a vast majority considers GT non canon doesnt mean EVERYONE sees it as non canon as far as I know a lot of people see GT as being canon even if it destroyed Dragonball for most. Also Toriyama doesnt even own Dragonball anymore. Its like saying everything past Season 4 of the Simpsons is no longer canon because by that time Matt Greoning stopped writing/producing the show since hes the original creator. And saying Battle of Gods is canon just because toriyama designed and wrote some of the stuff is also saying every other movie is canon since Toriyama did have involvement in production of those like he did with Gods, as far as Im aware he designed broly, coola, android 13, etc and had direct input in them so if you consider Gods canon you have to consider every other movie Canon.

Yes, the way the narrative is moving seems to set that storyline up. But think about Snake Eater for a second. Think about the way the entire world thinks about and knows The Boss. According to them she's a traitor. But we were there, and are privy to a whole lot more than everyone else. We know she's no traitor, we know what a true hero she was. Now consider what we know about Snake vs what we know of Big Boss from the pre - Snake Eater games. Perhaps the cycle repeats itself, and Big Boss gets painted with the same brush. After MGS V ends, we realize that our guy, our hero for over ten years (in our time) was never the villain that he was made out to be, or that everyone is expecting him to become in this game. And only we know it. For the rest of his life/the series, he will be considered a monster, but that's just his lot in life.

uid_935740,They're probably using duct tape by now.,2010-10,0,"Four or five summers ago, as a physics undergrad, I spent the summer at the University of Maryland's Materials Research Science and Engineering Center as a research assistant. The group I was working with were studying the electronic properties of ""2-D"" materials -- specifically graphene and dichalcogenides. We did indeed use Scotch tape to peel apart layers of graphite, and then put them on a slide. Of course, this didn't uniformly create single or double layers of graphite -- but it did create *some*. So the task was *finding* the graphene. Interestingly, there are significant color differences under an optical microscope between 1-layer, 2-layer, and multilayer graphite, so we could actually find graphene just by looking at it. But then you'd have to be able to find it reproducibly, since w would usually want to actually study these with an electron microscope or some other tool, which got trickier. So we used e-beam lithography to lay down a labeled gridwork of gold on the slides before smearing the Scotch tape-separated graphite on them. Then, we would use the optical microscope to find the graphene pieces, and be able to say ""Okay, on slide 7 I seem to have graphene at B9 on the grid."" Then, because gold shows up perfectly well on an STEM, we were able to use the grid to locate the graphene under the electron microscope. At that point, we could use the electron microscope and e-beam lithography to attach gold leads to the tiny graphene pieces, later allowing us to apply a voltage to them and measure responses. If we got any interesting or useful results, things that might be worth including in published work, we would need to verify for sure that the piece we were using really was single-layer (and therefore, graphene) -- which would typically involve a trip downstairs to the atomic force microscope, with which could verify the actual thickness of the piece. Disclaimer: I was only there for a summer, and I worked more with the single-layer dichalcogenides than with graphene. Also, as I said, this was four or five years ago -- no doubt everything is quite different now.",2,2,science,barlister

Look at all the great wholesome things they do. Then Edward comes. Edward does something offensive, then follows up by doing something super hammy. This makes the good people seem even better."" Example One: I was watching over my seven hundred adopted cats that I routinely take to old folks homes to act as stress reduction (don't worry I spend 80 hours a week cleaning up after then so Sweetie doesn't get sick) when suddenly Edward comes in and says that cats are dumb and kicks one. ""Don't kick the cat, Edward"", I say, when he slips and falls backwards from kicking the cat and can't get up because he is too fat. *filler dialogue* We bake a vegan super chocolate dessert with vanilla beans grown by blind Himalayan monks (PM me for the recipe) but sorry Edward is still with us. Example Two: When GoodPerson, NiceGuy and I were living in our mystery mansion full of exotic animals financed by an extremely wealthy but horribly sick mutual friend like some kind of bizarre mix of **Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends** and **X-Men**, we decided to have a party and invited the local sheriff, the town mayor, an elderly holocaust survivor, a native american throat singer, and a sociopath. Goodperson made the punch and put it in the fridge next to the unmarked jar of urine we keep on hand for testing Sickly's blood crystal urine content. Edward came out of his room and stomped his fat feet down the stairs and yelled at everyone a variety of racial and homophobic slurs. ""No Edward don't do that."" We said. He said that only queers have parties without punch. ""But we made punch, it is in the fridge."" we said.

Control and mid-range can sit back and leave the bear/explosive trap until they have board control and not attack face until they can also handle the potential bear. It is likely that when you win, the small amount of damage lost by not hitting face for a few turns is insignificant and you are winning by a landslide. So bear trap is really good against aggro and bad against other archetypes, but then explosive trap is probably better against other aggro, so I'm not sure of the bears value.

Anyways, I have seen a few videos and from the looks of it looks pretty good. I am a huge fan of ARPGs, which I know this is not, but I have heard there is a random loot system in the game? Correct? I am a huge fan of RPGs and character customization games. Games like Skyrim, Torchlight2, D2 &amp; D3, dragon age, Mass effect, etc. The only thing that really concerns me about the game is the combat system and how it works. I know its turn based but is it along the lines of XCOM? Because I couldn't get into that game and I wasn't a fan of it. Hopefully, that is not the case with this game, but if it is, its not a big deal. Anyways, hopefully you have enough to go on to either recommend this game or not to me.

It doesn't cause pain normally, but it can, and because of that she can get pain medication also. She has full medical from FIL military service, and something from social security because of her condition. She doesn't work, doesn't volunteer or anything, FIL is retired, but she has ""no time"" to go to the doctor. She isn't an addict or anything, and as far as I know is in legit pain. And to current times- FIL called me at 10:30 last night for Gem. ""Gem needs to know if you have a few pain pills she can have."" No. No I don't. She needs to go to the doctor, and I'm not a pharmacy. Yes I know it is NYE, sorry, I do feel for her.

It was Suede back in the early 90s, and the venue had people packed in waaaayyyy over capacity. Plus the fire doors were locked. I'm 5ft 3"" and back then, I weighed only about 7 stone. I was where the mosh pit should be, if it didn't actually stretch all the way to the back wall. I'd got some tall blokes around me (all strangers) and it got so packed that I was lifted off my feet by the force of it. I was only upright, because I was wedged against those lads. Second song in, it was a big hit at the time and so the place went wild. The lad next to me stumbled and that gave me enough space to go under. There was no room to get me out. People fell on top of people on top of people. It went so dark and too warm. I couldn't breathe, but it was ok. That's something which has always been so weird about this. I almost miss it. My body must have been flooded with all the adrenaline, endorphins and whatever else activates, when the flight or fight kicks in, but there's nothing you can do. I was in the most serene, beautiful place, with no pain at all. There was no sense of time down there. I could have been there for seconds or hours. I knew the moment when bodies were lifted off me enough to allow me to gasp in red hot air. But that was more or less all. I was fine. I was totally fine. Like I said, I half miss being down there. I could hear this woman screaming. You know that tone and desperation that makes you want to just drop everything, in order to rush and save them? Her scream was like that. I couldn't do anything to help her. My face was clear, but the rest of my body was still trapped under several others (a witness later said there were at least nine with me on the bottom). All I could do was lie there, hearing the pitch of her panic and willing the lads around us to forget me - I'm fine - just get her the fuck out! Seconds, hours, a lifetime later, two fingers pressed under my chin. I don't know how the sweet proverbial he did it, but a bloke lifted me enough WITH HIS TWO FINGERS in order to grab my head and yank me free that way. A ring of lads held back the entire over-packed surging crowd to give him the tiniest space to do that. That complete stranger held me aloft in his hands, like I was an infant being presented to the masses, or he was the Hulk or something. The adrenaline must have been pumping through him too. Six blokes pushed a path before us, and he carried me through the press and out into safety of the corridor.
